If you know of any attributes that are not written on this page, or if the descriptions of the attributes are wrong, please let the authors of this guide know! 1. Hit Points \u00b6 ID: 0 Purpose: This attribute refers to the health of the units. 2. Line Of Sight \u00b6 ID: 1 Purpose: This is the distance a unit can see around itself. 3. Garrison Capacity \u00b6 ID: 2 Purpose: This is the amount of units that can garrison inside another unit. 4. Unit Size X \u00b6 ID: 3 Purpose: This determines the x-size of the unit's collison hitbox (width of the unit). 5. Unit Size Y \u00b6 ID: 4 Purpose: This determines the y-size of the unit's collison hitbox (length of the unit). 6. Movement Speed \u00b6 ID: 5 Purpose: This is the movement speed of a unit, measured in tiles per second. 7. Rotation Speed \u00b6 ID: 6 Purpose: This is the rate at which units can rotate, measured in seconds per frame (this many seconds must pass before the object can switch to the next rotation frame). For example, for a trebuchet to start attacking a building facing the opposite direction, it has to rotate to face that way first. 8. Armor \u00b6 ID: 8 Purpose: This is the quantity of armour a unit has on any of its Armour Classes . If you do not know what an Armour Class is, refer to the Damage Calculation section of this guide. Note that changing the armour through this option will show it as being added to the base armour amount. (for example: 4+4) 9. Attack \u00b6 ID: 9 Purpose: This is the quantity of attack a unit has on any of its Attack Classes . If you do not know what an Attack Class is, refer to the Damage Calculation section of this guide. Note that changing the attack through this option will show it as being added to the base attack amount. (for example: 6+2) 10. Attack Reload Time \u00b6 ID: 10 Purpose: This is the minimum time that must pass before a unit is able to fire another shot. For melee units it is the minimum time between two successive hits that they can do. 11. Accuracy Percent \u00b6 ID: 11 Purpose: This determines how accurately a unit can aim at another unit. Trivia1: This accuracy is the accuracy of a unit to fire at the exact centre of its target. If the shot fired is not aimed at the exact centre of the target, it may still hit the target if its not off by too much since it can still land within the hitbox of the target, just not at the exact centre. Thus, bigger targets are actually easier to hit, which explains why buildings are an easier target to hit for trebuchets than small units. The chances that a missed shot still manages to hit the target also depend on the distance between the target and the attacking unit. A target that is farther away is \"visually\" smaller, so it is easier for a missed shot to land outside the units hitbox. These images may help in explaining why: In this image, you can see that shots that were fired in the red area in the 2 nd scenario would've hit if the target had been closer like in the first scenario, but since the target is far away, they actually miss. More technically, the visual angle of an object of the same size that is farther away is smaller, thus giving a smaller room for error for the shot in terms of the range of angles that will make the shot hit. Trivia2: The chance of a unit getting converted by a monk is also determined by its accuracy. Trivia3: If you modify an onager to have a big blast radius and give it a small accuracy, then attack a lot of units bunched together, the accuracy determines what percentage of units take damage from the blast of the onager! This is the reason why warwolf trebuchets get 100% accuracy because otherwise the blast wouldn't damage all of the units. Another interesting consequence of this is the delete trick with onagers and mangonels. This is where a mangonel is deleted immediately after it fires its shot and because a dead unit doesn't have an accuracy, it defaults to 100% and thus deals more damage to all the units in the blast radius. Note: There are two other factors that play a role in determining the damage from the shot fired by the deleted mangonel. The damage from a mangonel's shot is decreased over distance when moving outward from the centre of the blast (the targeted point). However, when the mangonel is deleted, this decrease over distance doesn't happen, and the projectile deals the full 100% damage to all the units in the blast radius! A shot that is fired from lower elevation would normally deal only 75% of its normal damage due to the elevation damage reduction. deleting a mangonel in this case also makes the damage the full 100% as if there was no elevation difference. 12. Max Range \u00b6 ID: 12 Purpose: This is the maximum range of a unit. Note that to be able to shoot at a target, it must be visible to the unit via its own line of sight or from another unit's line of sight. 13. Work Rate \u00b6 ID: 13 Purpose: This is the work rate for any unit that can do work. Villagers, Fishing Ships, Serjeants. 14. Carry Capacity \u00b6 ID: 14 Purpose: This is the carry capacity of Villagers. 15. Base Armor \u00b6 ID: 15 Purpose: This is the quantity of base armour a unit has on any of its Armour Classes . If you do not know what an Armour Class is, refer to the Damage Calculation section of this guide. Note that changing the armour through this option will show it as the base armour itself, and it will not be added to the regular amount. 16. Projectile Unit \u00b6 ID: 16 Purpose: This is the ID of the projectile that a unit fires. 17. Building Icon Override \u00b6 ID: 17 Purpose: The functionality of this attribute is unknown as it doesn't always behave certainly. If you know what this attribute does, please let the authors of this guide know! 18. Terrain Defense Bonus \u00b6 ID: 18 Purpose: This determines the percentage reduction in damage when fighting downhill. Note: Changing this attribute tends to crash the game, you have been warned! 19. Enable Smart Projectiles \u00b6 ID: 19 Purpose: This property controls the following two properties: Property Flag Value Has Ballistics 1 Deal full damage on missed hit 2 For example, if we set this property of the projectile used by an archer to 1 , it will have ballistics. (This is exactly what researching ballistics does in the first place). If we set this property to 2 , a missed projectile that hits another unit will deal its full damage instead of the 50% that it would normally do. What if we want to enable both properties at once? This is achieved by adding the flag values for both of them together. Setting this property to 3 enables both effects. 20. Minimum Range \u00b6 ID: 20 Purpose: The minimum distance a unit must be from an attacking unit for the attacking unit to be able to fire its projectile. 21. Amount Of 1 st Resources \u00b6 ID: 21 Purpose: This is the amount of 1 st resource contained in any unit. Refer to A.G.E. to see which resource this is. If you do not know what A.G.E. is, refer to the Data Mods section of this guide. 22. Blast Width \u00b6 ID: 22 Purpose: All enemy units inside this radius take damage from an attacking unit. This is used by elephants, Druzhina Halberdiers, and Logistica Cataphracts. 23. Search Radius \u00b6 ID: 23 Purpose: The maximum distance at which a unit can detect and auto attack enemy units. 24. Bonus Damage Resist \u00b6 ID: 24 Purpose: Used by Sicilians for the 50% bonus damage resistance. Set to 0.5 for all Sicilian land military units except siege 25. Icon ID \u00b6 ID: 25 Purpose: The ID of the icon that you want a unit to show 26. Hero Status \u00b6 ID: 40 Purpose: The hero status of a unit can control the following six properties: Property Flag Value Full Hero Status (enables everything below) 1 Cannot be converted 2 Self Regeneration (30 HP/minute) 4 Defensive Stance by Default 8 Protected Formation by Default 16 Safe Delete Confirmation 32 Hero Glow 64 Invert All Flags (except flag 1) 128 For example, if we set the hero status of a knight to 2, a monk will not be able to convert it. If we set the hero status of a militia to 4, it will regenerate HP automatically. What if we want to enable multiple properties at once? This is achieved by adding the flag values for those properties together and setting the hero status to that value. For example, if we want to make a paladin both unconvertable and regenerate HP automatically, we can set its hero status to 2+4 = 6. This means that the hero status of a unit can take on any values in the range 1-63. If you set it to any other value, it does not have any effect on the unit This works because notice that there is one and only one way to add different flag values together to obtain a particular value for the hero status! For example, if we have a value of 20 for the hero status of a unit, the only way to make 20 from the above flag values is to add 4 and 16. Thus, we know that the properties corresponding to the flag values 4 (self regeneration) and 16 (protected formation by default) must be enabled for that unit. This is a consequence of the fact that every number can be represented as a unique sum of powers of two (binary numbers) 27. Frame Delay \u00b6 ID: 41 Purpose: The amount of delay between the point when the attacking animation starts and the actual hit happening for military units. This is what makes Cavalry Archers annoying to micro. 28. Train Location \u00b6 ID: 42 Purpose: The ID of the unit that trains any given unit. Barracks train Militia, so the train location of a Militia is the ID of the Barracks 29. Train Button \u00b6 ID: 43 Purpose: The button used for training any given unit. For example, Militia are trained by using the first button, hence the Button Location of Militia is 1. This number ranges from 0-15 30. Blast Attack Level \u00b6 ID: 44 Purpose: A unit deals blast damage to other units with equal or higher Blast Defense Level that are in its blast radius. For example, while mangonels (blast attack: 2) can damage your own units (blast defense of all player owned units is always 2), scorpions (blast attack: 3) cannot do the same. Effect Blast Level damage resources, nearby allied units and tress 0 damage trees, nearby allied units 1 damage nearby allied units 2 damage targeted unit only 3 Blast attack can be modified to behave differently by adding to it the flag value of ONE of the following modifiers: Modifier Flag Value Deal a fixed 5 HP of damage to nearby units 4 Deal 50% of unit's own damage to nearby units 8 Deal 25% of unit's own damage to nearby units 16 Deal 33% of unit's own damage to nearby units 32 Attenuate damage as distance from the centre of attack increases (infantry only) 64 31. Blast Defense Level \u00b6 ID: 45 Purpose: A unit feels the blast damage from other units with equal or lower Blast Attack Level and if it is inside the attacker's blast radius. For example, while onagers (blast attack: 1) can cut trees (blast defense 1), mangonels (blast attack: 2) cannot do the same. Effect Blast Level damage resources, nearby allied units and tress 0 damage trees, nearby allied units 1 damage nearby allied units 2 damage targeted unit only 3 32. Shown Attack \u00b6 ID: 46 Purpose: The amount of attack that is displayed as a unit's attack (may not actually be the true attack) 33. Shown Range \u00b6 ID: 47 Purpose: The quantity that is displayed as a unit's attack ingame (may not actually be the true attack) 34. Shown Melee Armor \u00b6 ID: 48 Purpose: The quantity that is displayed as a unit's melee armour ingame (may not actually be the true armour) 35. Shown Pierce Armor \u00b6 ID: 49 Purpose: The quantity that is displayed as a unit's pierce armour ingame (may not actually be the true armour) 36. Object Name ID \u00b6 ID: 50 Purpose: The string ID to use for the name of an object. A string ID is used for refering to strings that the game recognises by default. It can be used to automatically set names by using a value that the game recognises. Trying out the value 1 on a unit and seeing what happens is left as an excersise for the reader. 37. Short Description ID \u00b6 ID: 51 Purpose: The string ID for the Short Description of an object. A string ID is used for refering to strings that the game recognises by default. It can be used to automatically set a Short Description by using a value that the game recognises. Trying out the value 1 on a unit and seeing what happens is left as an excersise for the reader. 38. Terrain Restriction ID \u00b6 ID: 53 Purpose: This number determines how a unit interacts with terrains and which terrains it can walk on. Effect Terrain Restriction ID All 0 Land And Shallows 1 Beach 2 Water Small Trail 3 Land 4 Nothing 5 Water No Trail 6 All Except Water 7 Land Except Farm 8 Nothing 9 Land And Beach 10 Land Except Farm 11 All Except Water Bridge Cannon 12 Water Medium Trail 13 All Except Water Bridge 14 Water Large Trail 15 Grass And Beach 16 Water And Bridge Except Beach 17 All Except Water Bridge Spear 18 Only Water And Ice 19 All Except Water2 20 Shallow Water 21 All Dart 22 All Arrow 23 All Cannon 24 All Spear 25 All Dart2 26 All Explosion 27 Unknown 28 Unknown2 29 Water Smallest Trail 30 39. Dead Unit ID \u00b6 ID: 57 Purpose: This is the unit to spawn in place of any given unit when it dies. All dead corpses are actually units that just cannot be selected, meaning this value can be changed to a non dead unit. This is how the dismounted konnik spawns and how the exploding villagers mod works. 40. HotKey ID \u00b6 ID: 58 Purpose: This number determines which hotkey is assigned to a unit. 41. Resource Costs \u00b6 ID: 100 Purpose: Refers to the first resource cost of a unit. Refer to A.G.E. to see which resource cost that is. If you do not know what A.G.E. is, refer to the Data Mods section of this guide. 42. Train Time \u00b6 ID: 101 Purpose: This is the amount of time it takes to create a unit. 43. Total Missiles \u00b6 ID: 102 Purpose: This is the number of projectiles a unit fires. The Chu Ko Nu fires 3 and the Elite Chu Ko Nu fires 5. 44. Food Costs \u00b6 ID: 103 Purpose: The food cost of a unit. 45. Wood Costs \u00b6 ID: 104 Purpose: The wood cost of a unit. 46. Gold Costs \u00b6 ID: 105 Purpose: The gold cost of a unit. 47. Stone Costs \u00b6 ID: 106 Purpose: The stone cost of a unit. 48. Max Total Missiles \u00b6 ID: 107 Purpose: The maximum number of projectiles a unit can fire when other units are garrisoned inside of it. A castle fires 5 projectiles by default but can fire more if units are garrisoned inside it. This attribute controls the maximum number of those 49. Garrison Heal Rate \u00b6 ID: 108 Purpose: The rate measured in HP/s at which garissoned units are healed inside a given building. 50. Regeneration Rate \u00b6 ID: 109 Purpose: The rate measured in HP/minute at which units heal themselves. This value is overridden to 30 HP/minute if the flag for Self Regeneration is set in the Hero Status of a unit.","title":"Attributes"},{"location":"general/attributes/#1-hit-points","text":"ID: 0 Purpose: This attribute refers to the health of the units.","title":"1.

The Purpose \u00b6 Have you ever wondered how bonus damage works in AoE2? How does a Halberdier get its +32 damage against cavalry? How does a Cataphract only take +16 damage from Halbderdiers instead of the full 32? How does a leitis do damage while ignoring all armour? And finally, how could you give bonus damage or armour against bonus damage to units for yourself? Lets find the answers to these questions by learning about the armour and attack class system of AoE2 2. Why do you, a map maker, need to know this? \u00b6 Understanding how damage calculation works and how attacks from one unit to another are calculated is essential for modding and using some of the effects in triggers. Aside from that, it is quite interesting in itself to know how damage is calculated behind the scenes in the game. 3. The System \u00b6 3.1. Introduction \u00b6 Each unit in the game has two essential properties, a list of Attack Classes and a list of Armour Classes . These are also commonly called the Damage Classes , and are used to calculate the damage each unit does to any other unit. There are a total of 36 damage classes in the game but pierce and melee damage classes are the most commonly known ones, as they are the only ones which are actually shown in game. There is also a 3 rd property that we need to know about, which is the Base Armour . This is almost always set to 1000 for every unit. 3.2. List of Damage Classes \u00b6 The following are all the damage classes along with their IDs that exist in the game: (Note that the Armour Classes have the same names and ids as the Attack classes, the reason for this will become clear once you read through the explanation provided below) Class Name ID Wonder 0 Infantry 1 Turtle Ships 2 Base Pierce 3 Base Melee 4 War Elephants 5 Unused 6 Unused 7 Cavalry 8 Unused 9 Unused 10 All Buildings (except Port) 11 Unused 12 Stone Defense 13 Predator Animals 14 Archers 15 Ships Saboteers (camels pre AK) 16 Rams 17 Trees 18 Unique Units 19 Siege Weapons 20 Standard Buildings 21 Walls & Gates 22 Gunpowder Units 23 Boars 24 Monks 25 Castle 26 Spearmen 27 Cavalry Archers 28 Eagle Warriors 29 Camels (post AK) 30 Leitis (ignores all armour) 31 Condottiero 32 Unused 33 Fishing Ship 34 Mamelukes 35 Heroes and King 36 The explanation of how this system works is given using the example of a Halberdier vs War Elephant, but this method is a general method applicable to any two units fighting each other (At first glance, all of this may seem daunting, but it will get clearer as we walk through the two examples given below!) 3.3. Explanation Using Maths \u00b6 The case of the Halberdier attacking the War Elephant: Attack Classes Halberdier Quantity Armour Classes War Elephant Quantity - - 3 (Base Pierce) 2 4 (Base Melee) 6 4 (Base Melee) 1 5 (War Elephants) 28 5 (War Elephants) 0 8 (Cavalry) 32 8 (Cavalry) 0 16 (Ships & Saboteers) 17 - 17 - - 19 (Unique Units) 17 21 (Standard Buildings) 1 - - 29 (Eagle Warriors) 1 - - 30 (Camels) 26 - - - - 31 (Leitis) 26 34 (Fishing Ship) 17 - - 35 (Mamelukes) 11 - - Here you can see all the attack classes listed out for the Halberdier and the armour classes listed out for the War Elephant. For calculating the total amount of damage that this unupgraded Halberdier deals to the unupgraded War Elephant, we go through these steps given below: Identify the damage classes that are in common for the attacking unit's attack class list and the defending unit's armour class list. The damage classes which are in common are: Base Melee (4) , War Elephants (5) and Cavalry (8) (they are also highlighted in the table above) for which the War Elephant has armour classes and the Halberdier has attack classes. For each damage class that is in common, subtract the armour of the defending unit from the attack of the attacking unit. Round up to 0 if you get a negative value. Here, \\(\\color{yellow} Ar_i\\) is the quantity of the armour class with id \\(i\\) for the War Elephant. For example, \\(\\color{yellow} Ar_{19}\\) refers to the Unique Units armour class of the War Elephant. \\(\\color{#bfe3b4} At_i\\) is the quantity of the attack class with id \\(i\\) for the Halberdier. For example, \\(\\color{#bfe3b4} At_{16}\\) refers to the Ships and saboteer attack class of the Halberdier. \\(\\color{yellow} Ba\\) is the Base Armour value for the defending unit, the war elephant. (Note that the ids for every armour class in the game can be found in the table under the topic 3.2.) Melee Damage Class: \\(dmg_4 = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} At_4-\\color{yellow} Ar_4, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_4 = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 6-\\color{yellow} 1, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_4 = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 5, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_4 = \\color{#ff6961} 5\\) War Elephant Damage Class: \\(dmg_5 = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} At_5-\\color{yellow} Ar_5, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_5 = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 28-\\color{yellow} 0, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_5 = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 28, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_5 = \\color{#ff6961} 28\\) Cavalry Damage Class: \\(dmg_8 = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} Ar_8-\\color{yellow} At_8, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_8 = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 32-\\color{yellow} 0, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_8 = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 32, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_8 = \\color{#ff6961} 32\\) For each attack class of the attacking unit for which there is no armour class for the defending unit, we use the base armour value to calculate how much attack needs to be dealt. Ships & Saboteers Damage Class: \\(dmg_{16} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} At_{16}-\\color{yellow} Ba, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{16} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 17-\\color{yellow} 1000, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{16} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} -983, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{16} = \\color{#ff6961} 0\\) Standard Buildings: \\(dmg_{21} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} At_{21}-\\color{yellow} Ba, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{21} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 1-\\color{yellow} 1000, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{21} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} -999, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{21} = \\color{#ff6961} 0\\) Eagle Warriors: \\(dmg_{29} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} At_{29}-\\color{yellow} Ba, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{29} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 1-\\color{yellow} 1000, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{29} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} -999, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{29} = \\color{#ff6961} 0\\) Camels: \\(dmg_{30} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} At_{30}-\\color{yellow} Ba, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{30} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 26-\\color{yellow} 1000, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{30} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} -974, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{30} = \\color{#ff6961} 0\\) Fishing Ships: \\(dmg_{34} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} At_{34}-\\color{yellow} Ba, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{34} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 17-\\color{yellow} 1000, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{34} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} -983, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{34} = \\color{#ff6961} 0\\) Fishing Ships: \\(dmg_{35} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} At_{35}-\\color{yellow} Ba, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{35} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 11-\\color{yellow} 1000, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{35} = \\color{#ff6961}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} -989, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#ff6961})\\) \\(dmg_{35} = \\color{#ff6961} 0\\) Trick: Remember, the value for Base Armour is almost always 1000, so unless the unit has an attack of more than 1000 in an attack class, they practically have no effect on the amount of damage dealt! This above calculation with base armour can thus be skipped if that is the case Now add all of the differences found above. Round up to 1 if you get 0. \\(dmg = \\color{#add8e6} max( \\color{#bfe3b4} dmg_4 + dmg_5 + dmg_8 +\\) \\(\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\color{#bfe3b4}dmg_{16} + dmg_{21} + dmg_{29} + dmg_{30} + dmg_{34} + dmg_{35}, \\; \\color{#bfe3b4} 1 \\color{#add8e6})\\) \\(dmg = \\color{#add8e6} max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 5+28+32+0, \\; \\color{#bfe3b4} 1 \\color{#add8e6})\\) \\(dmg = \\color{#add8e6} max( \\color{#bfe3b4} 65, \\; \\color{#bfe3b4} 1 \\color{#add8e6})\\) \\(dmg = 65\\) The value thus obtained is the damage that the Halberdier deals to the War Elephant. The General formula for damage calculation between any two units is thus: if \\(\\color{#a66fb5} D\\) is the set of all attack classes for the attacking unit, \\(\\color{#bfe3b4} At_i\\) is the quanitity of the attack class with id \\(i\\) for the attacking unit. For example, \\(\\color{#bfe3b4} At_1\\) refers to the Infantry attack class of the unit. \\(\\color{yellow} Ar_i\\) is quantity of the armour class with id \\(i\\) for the defending unit. For example, \\(\\color{yellow} Ar_{19}\\) refers to the Unique Unit armour class of the defending unit. Note that if an armour class does not exist for the defending unit, use the base armour value in that case! (Note that the ids for every armour class in the game can be found in the table under the topic 3.2.) then: \\[ dmg = \\color{#ff6961} max( \\color{#a66fb5} \\sum\\limits_{\\forall \\; i \\; \\in D}^{} \\color{#add8e6}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} At_i-\\color{yellow} Ar_i, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#add8e6}), \\; \\color{white} 1 \\color{#ff6961}) \\] Note: \\(\\color{#a66fb5} \\sum\\limits_{\\forall \\; i \\; \\in D}^{}\\) means, add up something \\(for\\) \\(all\\) \\(i\\) \\(in\\) \\(D\\) 3.4. Explanation Using Code \u00b6 The case of the War Elephant attacking the Halberdier: Attack Classes War Elephant Quantity Armour Classes Halberdier Quantity - - 1 (Infantry) 2 - - 3 (Base Pierce) 2 4 (Base Melee) 15 4 (Base Melee) 1 11 (All buildings) 7 - - 13 (Stone Defense) 7 - - 21 (Standard Buildings) 0 - - - - 27 (Unique Units) 0 - - 31 (Unique Units) 0 Here you can see all the attack classes listed out for the War Elephant and the armour classes listed out for the Halberdier. For calculating the total amount of damage that this unupgraded War Elephant deals to the unupgraded Halberdier, we go through these steps given below: Identify the damage classes that are in common for the attacking unit's attack class list and the defending unit's armour class list. For each damage class that is in common, subtract the armour of the defending unit from the attack of the attacking unit. Round up to 0 if you get a negative value. For each attack class of the attacking unit for which there is no armour class for the defending unit, we use the base armour value to calculate how much attack needs to be dealt. Now add all of the differences found above. Round up to 1 if you get 0. The value thus obtained is the damage that the War Elephant deals to the Halberdier. The only common damage class is Base Melee (4) (highlighted in the table above) This means that the damage that the War Elephant does to the Halberdier is simply given by \\(dmg = 15-1 = 14\\) (The calculation with the base armour is not shown here since no attack class has an attack of more than 1000 to overecome the base armour) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 damage = 0 # 1. for each attack_class that the attacking unit has for attack_class , attack in attacker . attack_classes : used_armour = target . base_armour # almost always 1000 if attack_class in targer . armour_classes : used_armour = target . armour_classes [ attack_class ] # 2. Find the difference of the attacker's attack and the target's armour. # If the difference is negative, round it up to 0. Add this value to damage damage = damage + max ( attack - used_armour , 0 ) # if the total damage is less than 1, round it up to 1 damage = max ( damage , 1 ) Every unit in the game always has the Base Pierce (3) , Base Melee (4) and Leitis (31) damage classes. Every unique unit in the game always has the 19 (Unitque Unit) armour class. (Can you think of where this armour class is used? Hint: which unit deals bonus damage to all unique units?) In this manner, the damage classes determine which units deal bonus damage to other units 3.5. Answering the questions \u00b6 After having gone through this, can you now think of the answers to the questions posed at the beginning of the guide? Q1. How does a Cataphract only take +16 damage from Halbderdiers instead of the full 32? Q2. How does a leitis do damage while ignoring all armour? Q3. How to give bonus damage or bonus damage resistance to a particular unit? Before you move on to read the answers, try and think about how these bonus damages might be being achieved. A1. Cataphracts have 16 armour on the Cavalry (8) armour class, which is the attack class used by Halberdiers for extra 32 damage vs regular cavalry. A2. The leitis uses the attack class Leitis (31) for all of its damage, and no unit has any armour on this armour class, which is why it seems like the damage from leitis \"ignores\" all armour. A3. One of the unused damage classes can be used for this purpose. Giving the desired unit attack on an unused class and giving the target unit 0 armour on the same unused class will produce the effect of the desired unit doing bonus damage to the target unit. 3.6. The Sicilian 50% Bonus Damage Reduction \u00b6 The damage from all classes except the Base Pierce (3) , Base Melee (4) and Leitis (31) is multiplied by 0.5 before it is added to the total damage for Sicilian units. This property of bonus damage resistance is controlled by the Bonus Damage Resist attribute of a unit. (Yes, every single unit can have a different value for this)","title":"Damage Calculation"},{"location":"general/damage_calculation/#the-armour-attack-class-system-the-backbone-of-age-of-empires-ii","text":"Written by: Alian713","title":"The Armour &amp; Attack Class System: The Backbone of Age of Empires II"},{"location":"general/damage_calculation/#1-the-purpose","text":"Have you ever wondered how bonus damage works in AoE2?

This above calculation with base armour can thus be skipped if that is the case Now add all of the differences found above.

The General formula for damage calculation between any two units is thus: if \\(\\color{#a66fb5} D\\) is the set of all attack classes for the attacking unit, \\(\\color{#bfe3b4} At_i\\) is the quanitity of the attack class with id \\(i\\) for the attacking unit.

For example, \\(\\color{yellow} Ar_{19}\\) refers to the Unique Unit armour class of the defending unit. Note that if an armour class does not exist for the defending unit, use the base armour value in that case! (Note that the ids for every armour class in the game can be found in the table under the topic 3.2.) then: \\[ dmg = \\color{#ff6961} max( \\color{#a66fb5} \\sum\\limits_{\\forall \\; i \\; \\in D}^{} \\color{#add8e6}max( \\color{#bfe3b4} At_i-\\color{yellow} Ar_i, \\; \\color{white} 0 \\color{#add8e6}), \\; \\color{white} 1 \\color{#ff6961}) \\] Note: \\(\\color{#a66fb5} \\sum\\limits_{\\forall \\; i \\; \\in D}^{}\\) means, add up something \\(for\\) \\(all\\) \\(i\\) \\(in\\) \\(D\\)","title":"3.3.

For calculating the total amount of damage that this unupgraded War Elephant deals to the unupgraded Halberdier, we go through these steps given below: Identify the damage classes that are in common for the attacking unit's attack class list and the defending unit's armour class list. For each damage class that is in common, subtract the armour of the defending unit from the attack of the attacking unit. Round up to 0 if you get a negative value. For each attack class of the attacking unit for which there is no armour class for the defending unit, we use the base armour value to calculate how much attack needs to be dealt. Now add all of the differences found above. Round up to 1 if you get 0. The value thus obtained is the damage that the War Elephant deals to the Halberdier. The only common damage class is Base Melee (4) (highlighted in the table above) This means that the damage that the War Elephant does to the Halberdier is simply given by \\(dmg = 15-1 = 14\\) (The calculation with the base armour is not shown here since no attack class has an attack of more than 1000 to overecome the base armour) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 damage = 0 # 1. for each attack_class that the attacking unit has for attack_class , attack in attacker . attack_classes : used_armour = target . base_armour # almost always 1000 if attack_class in targer . armour_classes : used_armour = target . armour_classes [ attack_class ] # 2.

Add this value to damage damage = damage + max ( attack - used_armour , 0 ) # if the total damage is less than 1, round it up to 1 damage = max ( damage , 1 ) Every unit in the game always has the Base Pierce (3) , Base Melee (4) and Leitis (31) damage classes.

Q1. How does a Cataphract only take +16 damage from Halbderdiers instead of the full 32? Q2. How does a leitis do damage while ignoring all armour? Q3. How to give bonus damage or bonus damage resistance to a particular unit? Before you move on to read the answers, try and think about how these bonus damages might be being achieved. A1. Cataphracts have 16 armour on the Cavalry (8) armour class, which is the attack class used by Halberdiers for extra 32 damage vs regular cavalry. A2. The leitis uses the attack class Leitis (31) for all of its damage, and no unit has any armour on this armour class, which is why it seems like the damage from leitis \"ignores\" all armour. A3. One of the unused damage classes can be used for this purpose. Giving the desired unit attack on an unused class and giving the target unit 0 armour on the same unused class will produce the effect of the desired unit doing bonus damage to the target unit.","title":"3.5.

What is a hotkey? \u00b6 A hotkey is a key or combination of keys that can be pressed to allow for quick execution of certain tasks. For example, pressing Ctrl+1 allows you to set a control group of units that you can then quickly select by pressing 1 . The standard way to bind hotkeys to units and actions is to assign them through the ingame menu. While this works great for the standard ingame units, what if you want to give hotkeys to a unit when you are making a custom scenario, a random map with custom units or a mod? 2. About Hotkey IDs \u00b6 Every standard unit in the game has a \"Hotkey ID\" that tells the game which key is needed to be pressed for the hotkey. you can check A.G.E. to see what the value for the Hotkey ID for each unit is. If you do not know what A.G.E. is, refer to the Data Mods section of this guide. Setting one unit's hotkey ID to the same value as another unit will make the hotkey for the first unit the same as the second unit. For example, if you set the hotkey ID for militia to the same value as villagers, then the hotkey for creating militia will become the same as the one used for creating villagers. Similarly, if you set one building's hotkey ID to the same value as another building, it will make the hotkey for the first building the same as the second building. For example, if you set the hotkey ID for stables to the same value as houses, then the hotkey for creating stables will become the same as the one used for creating houses. Note that the above hotkeys can be different for different players. However, if you set a unit's hotkey ID to a building's hotkey ID (or vice versa) it won't actually assign the expected hotkey to the unit. In this case the hotkey assigned to the unit or building is a different, fixed key, which does not change for different players . For example, setting a villager's hotkey ID to the same as a house will always make the villager use Q as its hotkeys. How do we know which key this is going to be? This key is determined by the first character of the string (the text within quotes) corresponding to the hotkey ID in the file called key-value-strings-utf8.txt located in this directory: 1 PATH_TO_DE_FOLDER/AoE2DE/resources/en/strings/key-value/ If we search for the value 16344 in this file, which is the hotkey ID of the house, it can be seen that the string corresponding to it is \"Q\" and its first character is Q which is the hotkey that is used in this case. In fact, we can actually use any number from this file as a hotkey ID and the hotkey set by it is determined by the first character of the corresponding string. For example, the value 15188 has the string \"Gold Score\" corresponding to it, and its first character is G . This means the value 15188 sets the key G as the hotkey. Sometimes, the numbers in this file will have strings whoes starting characters are special characters. In this case, a different hotkey (this remains the same for a particular starting character) is used. The table below contains every unique starting character present in the strings file and the key that it corresponds to. 3.

See the For Programmers instead, it is a shorter and more precise documentation since XS is just another programming language but with different syntax. If you're not a programmer, fear not! You are at the right place to learn all about XS! 1. What is XS? \u00b6 XS stands for External Subroutines and it is a custom programming language that was made by Ensamble Studios. An XS Script can be used in an RMS and Custom Scenarios, and it is a program that can perform calculations and execute different functions and effects. 2. Using an XS \u00b6 To use an XS: Make sure you can see file extensions. That means that every file on your computer should have a name that looks something like filename.ext . If you can see file extensions, then proceed to step 2. If not, then follow these steps: Press + E Click View right at the top. On the right side of the panel that appears, there will be an option called File Name Extensions . Check this option if it is not already checked. Navigate to the folder: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\AoE2DE\\resources\\_common\\xs There should be 2 files in this folder already, called Constants.xs and xs.txt . In here, create a new file with any name ending with .xs . For example, the file can be called filename.xs default0.xs There may be an additional file called default0.xs . Never write code in this file as this is a temporary file and can be overwritten by the game. The file Constants.xs contains a list of constants that can be used in any XS Script, using their name. They are essentially constants that the XS language pre-defines for you. Now open this file that you just created in your favourite text/code editor! If you don't have one already, using Visual Studio Code (VSC) is recommended. A VSC Extension for syntax highlighting and code auto completion for AoE XS Scripting can be found here To begin with using XS, write this basic code in the file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 // Anything that is written after a double front slash is a comment. // A comment is a line that is ignored when running the script. // comments are useful for explaining your code to others and // more importantly, your future self. // writing comments is a good habit because it helps you understand your // own code better. // you will see comments widely used in this guide, to explain almost // every bit of code that you see // do note though, that even though commenting is a good practise, // over commenting code is a worse thing to do. Only comment stuff // that really needs commenting! /* Anything enclosed by a front slash and asterisk pair is a multi line comment */ // Here, you are creating a function that is called 'main'. void main () { // this line says that you have an integer called 'a' that has a value of 10. // note that almost every statement in XS is ended with a semi colon, // just like in english we use periods to indicate the end of a sentence. int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; // this line says that you make a new integer called 'c' and it is the sum of 'a' and 'b'. int c = a + b ; // this line will show in the game chat the value of 'c'. This shows '30' in chat. xsChatData ( \"\" + c ); } 2.1. In a Custom Scenario \u00b6 Open the scenario in the editor Under the Map tab, type the name of the XS Script that you created in the Script Filename field without the .xs at the end. For example, if your file is called filename.xs then you will write filename in this field. Now, under the Triggers tab in the editor, add a new trigger, then add a new effect. (If you do not know what a trigger/effect is, please go through the Custom Scenarios: Triggers: Trigger Basics section of this guide) From the Effects List select Script Call . You can now use the functions in the XS Script in the message box, by typing \"function_name_here();\" The main() function that we made above is automatically run when the scenario is played. If there are no errors in the code, clicking the E#0: Script Call effect will turn it green. If there is an error in the script, an error message will be shown. Testing the scenario now will run the Script Call effect in the trigger defined above, which in turn will run the main() function in the XS Script and 30 will be shown in the chat. 2.2. In an RMS \u00b6 Open the RMS file in a text editor At the very top, type #includeXS filename.xs . Here, filename.xs is the name of the file that you created above. The main() function that we made above is automatically run when a map is generated using the RMS. To test, load the RMS in a single player (or multi player) lobby and start the game. When the map is generated, the main() function in the XS Script will run and 30 will be shown in the chat. It is recommended that you use a custom scenario to test XS Scripts, as it is easier to debug them in the editor. Now that you have set up an XS file with a main() function inside, you can type code inside this function to do different things! We'll be walking through all of the different things that are known to be possible one by one, and things will become clearer. 3. Programming Concepts: \u00b6 3.1. Constants \u00b6 To do anything in an XS Script, we need constants. Any value that remains the same throughout the execution of the script is known as a constant. Quite literally, it remains constant throughout the execution of then script. For example, 10 is a constant. Every number is a constant. 3.2. Variables \u00b6 Variables are like boxes that are used to store constants. Variables are values that can change during the execution of the script! Think about it this way, if a variable is a box that stores a constant, that constant can be taken out and another one can be put in. Quite literally, it is a variable (it may change!). For example, the script that we saw earlier uses 3 variables, called a b and c . 1 2 3 4 5 6 void main () { int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; int c = a + b ; xsChatData ( \"\" + c ); } Some questions that you might have now are: What is this int that preceeds the variable's name? That is the \"data type\" of the variable! What is a data type you ask? Every variable in a script has a data type, that is, it tells you what kind of value is stored in the variable. Think about it this way, if you want to store water, you need to specify that it must be stored in a bottle. Isn't that kind of obvious you might say? While to a human it might be obvious, a computer is a dumb machine. It does not know what to do unless you tell it, it is like a baby who must be spoonfed every tiny detail and instruction for it to work properly. What other types of data types are there? There are a total of 5 data types supported by XS, they are: Integer ( int ) You have seen an int before, an integer is a data type that stores an integer quantity. An integer quantity may be negative, positive, or zero. It never has any fractional or decimal parts (for example, an integer never has 0.5 ). Usage: int a = 10 ; This declares a variable of type int called a with a value of 10 Floating Point ( float ) A float is a data type that can store values with fractional parts or decimals. For example 1.5 is a floating point value. Usage: float a = 3.14159 ; This declares a variable of type float called a with a value of 3.14159 Why would you ever use an int then? The reason is because computers take longer to perform calculations with floats! If you know that your calculation will not involve fractional values and decimals, you should always use an integer instead of a floating point value Boolean ( bool ) A bool is a data type, that can only store one of two different values, true or false . Any yes or no question is a boolean question in some sense, because there are only two answers, yes or no. Boolean variables are super important for conditions, which we will be looking at later. Usage: bool a = true ; This declares a variable of type bool called a with a value of true Note A value of true is also indicated by 1 and a value of false is also indicated by 0 . String ( string ) A string is a word, a phrase or a sentence. A string is always enclosed by double quotes. Usage: string a = \"this is a string! yay\" ; This declares a variable of type string called a with a value of \"this is a string! yay\" Vector ( vector ) A vector is a variable that can store the coordinates of a point ( x , y , z ) . If you don't know what that means, just take it as a variable that stores three different float values. The first value is called the \"X component\", the second value is called the \"Y component\" and the last value is called the \"Z component\". Usage vector v = vector ( 1.2 , 2.3 ., 3.2 ); This declares a variable of type vector called v that represents a point with coordinates ( 1.2 , 2.3 , 3.2 ) . Remember that your variable names can be almost anything! However, this does not mean that you should just use single letters or alphabets for variable names. Variable names should be chosen such that they represent, or hint to what the purpose of the variable is. Naming your variables such that they make intuitive sense is a good programming practise. How do I actually change a variable? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 void main () { int my_var = 20 ; // you only need to specify the data type of a variable once // when it is created. This \"first time\" creation is known // as \"variable declaration\" or \"initialisation\". // This way, when you change the value of the variable // you don't need to say that it is an integer again my_var = 30 ; // you can set variables equal to each other as well. int my_var2 = my_var ; // note that a variable can only be changed to another value // of a similar data type. This means that this following line // is WRONG: my_var = \"this is a string\" ; // trying to initialise a variable without a data type is also // WRONG: my_var3 = \"this string cannot be initalised since the data type is missing!\" ; float my_var4 = my_var ; } This process of changing the value that a variable stores is called \"assignment\". So in the above example, We first initalise my_var to 20 . Then we assign a value of 30 to my var . Then we initialise another variable called my_var2 whose value is equal to the value of my_var . Then we try to assign the string \"this is a string\" to my_var but remember that my_var is an integer, and it is not capable of storing a string, so this will actually give you an error. Think about it this way, you cannot put water in a paper bag, paper bags are not meant to store water! There is an exception to this rule: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 void main () { int a = 10 ; float b = 20.5 ; // the only cases where you can assign one type of data to another // is when going from integers to floats float c = a ; // this will show 10.0 in game chat xsChatData ( \"\" + c ); // or when going from floats to integers. // However, since integers cannot store the fractional part, // it is discarded! int d = b ; // this will show 20 in game chat xsChatData ( \"\" + d ); } Lastly, we try to initialise a new variable called my_var3 but we have not specified a data type! This will also give you an error. Think about it this way, if you want to store water, you need to specify if you want to use a paper bag or a water bottle. Can I make a variable whoes value cannot be changed? Yes! initialising a variable with the word const will make it a constant, and you won't be able to change its values. Usage: const int a = 10 ; If you now try to change the value of a , you will get an error. 3.3. Variable Naming Rules and Conventions: \u00b6 There are some rules that must be followed when naming a variable. They are: You can only use letters, numbers and underscores to name your variables. A variable name cannot start with a number. Variable names are CaSe SeNsItIvE . This means that a and A are two different variable names! Variable names must not be keywords. A keyword is a reserved word in any programming language that has a special meaning! For example, int is a keyword in XS because it is used to declare a variable of the int data type. While these are the only laws that you absolutely must follow, there are some conventions or unwritten rules that all programmers agree to follow to make their code more readable, and more clear. When you are writing a variable name that is just one word, it is conventional to write it in all small letters. For example int radius = 10 ; or string name = \"Alian713\" ; . When you are writing a variable name that consists of more than one word, then it is conventional to write it in a special case known as \"camel case\". Camel case is where the first letter of every word is capitalised except the first word. For Example: float gearRatio = 2.2 ; or string firstName = \"Bruce\" ; or string lastName = \"Wayne\" ; . When you are writing a variable that is supposed to just store the value of a constant, one which you never intend to change, it is conventional to use capital letters and words are separated by underscores. For example: float PI = 3.14159 ; or float GOLDEN_RATIO = 1.61803 ; . Variable names should be precise and mnemonic. That is, they should indicate to a casual programmer their purpose. Usage of single letter variable names is discouraged unless it is a throwaway or temporary variable. 3.4. Operations \u00b6 Now that we know how to store and change the values of a variable, what can we actually do with them? 1. Arithmetic Operations \u00b6 The most obvious thing that we can do with numbers, is do arithmetic with them. XS Scripts support the following five arithmetic operations: Addition: a+b this gives you the sum of two variables, a and b . for example, Subtraction: a-b this gives you the difference of two variables, a from b . Multiplication: a*b this gives you the product of two variables, a and b . For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 void main () { int a = 69 ; int b = 420 ; // this will chat 489 in game (69+420 = 489) xsChatData ( \"result of 420+69 = \" + ( a + b )); // this will chat 351 in game (420-69 = 351) xsChatData ( \"result of 420-69 = \" + ( b - a )); // this will chat 28980 in game (420*69 = 28980) xsChatData ( \"result of 420*69 = \" + ( a * b )); } Division: a/b this gives you the division of a by b . Note that in programming, division is weird with how it works for integers and floats: For int , it performs what we call \"integer division\": 5 / 2 = 2 17 / 6 = 2 Basically, you round down any fractional part to your answer when you do normal division for integers. For float , it performs regular division as you would expect: 5.0 / 2.0 = 2.5 17.0 / 6.0 = 2.83333 This gives you the exact result of division. What if you mix a float and an int ? In that case, regular division is used. Modulo: a%b this gives you the remainder when dividing a by b . DataType of Result of Operation Due to a bug at the moment, the data type of the answer of any operation is decided by the first number used in the operation. This means that 9 * 5.5 evaluates to 49 instead of 49.5 . However, 5.5 * 9 will correctly evaluate to 49.5 . Note that this is a bug in XS itself and will probably be fixed in a future update For Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 void main () { // this will chat 2 in game (5/2 = 2.5 but remember, this is integer division! so round down to 2) xsChatData ( \"result of 5/2 = \" + ( 5 / 2 )); // this will chat 2 in game (17/6 = 2.833 but remember, this is integer division! so round down to 2) xsChatData ( \"result of 17/6 = \" + ( 17 / 6 )); // this will chat 2.5 in game (since the numerator is a float, float division will give the exact value) xsChatData ( \"result of 5.0/2 = \" + ( 5.0 / 2 )); // this will chat 2 in game (since the numerator is an int, integer division will give the exact value) xsChatData ( \"result of 5/2.0 = \" + ( 5 / 2.0 )); // this will chat 5 in game (17%6 = 5) xsChatData ( \"result of 17%6 = \" + ( 17 % 6 )); // this should chat 0.5 in game (2.5%1 = 0.5) xsChatData ( \"result of 17%6 = \" + ( 2.5 % 1 )); // Due to a bug at the moment, this will actually show 0.0 // Modulo on fractions does not work properly at this time. } Also Additionally, when testing stuff using xsChatData , be wary of some quirks that this has: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 void main () { // Note that chat data does not send the same thing multiple consecutively // which means if two calculations have the same result, only the first // one is shown xsChatData ( \"this is shown only once\" ); xsChatData ( \"this is shown only once\" ); xsChatData ( \"this is shown only once\" ); xsChatData ( \"this is shown only once\" ); xsChatData ( \"this is shown twice\" ); xsChatData ( \"this will make them non consecutive\" ); xsChatData ( \"this is shown twice\" ); } The way around this is to use a unique number or letter at the start of every message so that even if the content of the message is the same, the number is different so that it gets shown the right amount of times 2. The Assignment Operation \u00b6 Remember that when we use the = sign in programming, it is not a mathematical equality statement. It actually tells us that we are assigning a value to a variable. So when you see something like a = a+1; , this means that you are simply adding 1 to the value of a . you are assigning the value a+1 to a . Once again, it is not a mathematical equality statement, it is an assignment. 3. Postfix Operations \u00b6 If you want to increase or decrease the value of a variable by one, then writing a = a + 1; or a = a - 1; is one way to do it. Writing a++; or a--; is another way to do it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 void main () { int a = 10 ; // increase the value of a to 11 a ++ ; // decrease the value of a back to 10 a -- ; } 4. Relational Operations \u00b6 Relational operations allow us to compare one number with another. With these, you can find out if one variable is greater than another or not, if two variables are equal or not, and much more. If you have two numbers \\(\\color{yellow} \\text{A}\\) and \\(\\color{yellow}\\text{B}\\) , and are asked \" \\(\\text{if} \\; \\color{yellow}\\text{A} \\; \\color{red} \\text{is greater than} \\; \\color{yellow}\\text{B} \\color{white}\\) ?\" then you can have only two possible answers, it will either be yes or no. Similarly, if you are asked \" \\(\\text{if} \\; \\color{yellow}\\text{A} \\; \\color{red} \\text{is equal to} \\; \\color{yellow}\\text{B} \\color{white}\\) ?\" then this question also has only two answers, yes or no. Whenever you use a relational operator, it is like asking one of these questions above. Then how does a computer answer a question like this? Remember, a boolean data type can either be true or false , it does exactly this! Thus, the answers to all relational operations give you boolean values. a < b This checks if the number a is lesser than b . If it is, then the expression evaluates to true , else it evaluates to false . For example: 1 2 3 // this will print \"5 < 10 : 1\" xsChatData ( \"5 < 10 : \" + ( 5 <> 10 )); // remember, in programming, 1 is the same as true a > b This checks if the number a is greater than b . If it is, then the expression evaluates to true , else it evaluates to false . For example: 1 2 3 // this will print \"5 > 10 : 0\" xsChatData ( \"5 > 10 : \" + ( 5 > 10 )); // remember, in programming, 0 is the same as false a <= b This checks if the number a is lesser than or equal to b . If it is, then the expression evaluates to true , else it evaluates to false . For example: 1 2 3 4 5 // this will print \"5 <= 10 : 1\" xsChatData ( \"5 <= 10 : \" + ( 5 <= 10 )); // this will print \"10 <= 10 : 1\" xsChatData ( \"10 <= 10 : \" + ( 10 <= 10 )); a >= b This checks if the number a is greater than or equal to b . If it is, then the expression evaluates to true , else it evaluates to false . For example: 1 2 3 4 5 // this will print \"5 >= 10 : 0\" xsChatData ( \"5 >= 10 : \" + ( 5 >= 10 )); // this will print \"10 >= 10 : 1\" xsChatData ( \"10 >= 10 : \" + ( 10 >= 10 )); a == b This checks if the number a is equal to b . If it is, then the expression evaluates to true , else it evaluates to false . For example: 1 2 3 4 5 // this will print \"5 == 10 : 0\" xsChatData ( \"5 == 10 : \" + ( 5 == 10 )); // this will print \"10 == 10 : 1\" xsChatData ( \"10 == 10 : \" + ( 10 == 10 )); a != b This checks if the number a is not equal to b . If it is, then the expression evaluates to true , else it evaluates to false . For example: 1 2 3 4 5 // this will print \"5 != 10 : 1\" xsChatData ( \"5 != 10 : \" + ( 5 != 10 )); // this will print \"10 != 10 : 0\" xsChatData ( \"10 != 10 : \" + ( 10 != 10 )); Relational Operators on Strings These relational operators also work on string values, for example a < b checks if a would alphabetically preceed b . For Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 void main () { // With numbers: int a = 10 ; float b = 20.0 ; int c = 30 ; // this would chat 1 xsChatData ( \"a < b is \" + a < b ); // this would chat 0 xsChatData ( \"b > c is \" + ( b > c )); // this would chat 0 xsChatData ( \"(a+b) == b is\" + (( a + b ) == b )); // this would chat 1 xsChatData ( \"(a+b) >= c is\" + (( a + b ) >= c )); // this would chat 1 xsChatData ( \"b <= c is \" + ( b <= c )); // With strings: string str1 = \"ball\" ; string str2 = \"apple\" ; string str3 = \"cat\" ; string str4 = \"cat\" ; // this would chat 0 in game // this is because alphabetically, str1 does not come before str2 xsChatData ( \"str1 < str2 is \" + ( str1 < str2 )); // this would chat 1 in game // this is because alphabetically, str2 comes before str3 xsChatData ( \"str3 > str2 is \" + ( str3 > str2 )); // this would cha ttrue xsChatData ( \"str3 == str4 is \" + ( str3 == str4 )); // this would cha ttrue xsChatData ( \"str1 != str2 is \" + ( str1 != str2 )); } 5. Boolean Operations \u00b6 If two or more things are required to do a task, we can say that \"this AND that are required to do the task\". For example: To write an email to someone, you must \" \\(\\color{yellow} \\text{have a computer} \\; \\color{red} \\text{and} \\; \\color{yellow} \\text{have active internet}\\) \" To paint something, you must \" \\(\\color{yellow} \\text{have a paper} \\; \\color{red} \\text{and} \\; \\color{yellow} \\text{have paint} \\; \\color{red} \\text{and} \\; \\color{yellow} \\text{have a paint brush}\\) \" Similarly, if only one, or more things are required to do a task we say that \"this OR that is needed to do the task\". For example: To play a video game, you need to \" \\(\\color{yellow} \\text{own a computer} \\; \\color{red} \\text{or} \\; \\color{yellow} \\text{own a gaming console}\\) \" Note that you can still play video games if you own both! To draw something you must \" \\(\\color{yellow} \\text{have a pencil} \\; \\color{red} \\text{or} \\; \\color{yellow} \\text{have a pen} \\; \\color{red} \\text{and} \\; \\color{yellow} \\text{have a paper}\\) \" Boolean operations allow us to ask these sorts of questions but with boolean values instead. For example, if you wanted to ask \"is A greater than B and C?\" then you require boolean operations. Boolean AND: This is used to check if two or more boolean values are simultaneously true . Usage: a && b (Here, a and b are boolean variables) This checks if both a AND b are true . If they are, the expression evaluates to true , otherwise it evaluates to false . Every combination of inputs and outputs for a && b can be written in a table: a b a && b false false false false true false true false false true true true Tip The AND operation is not limited to just two variables. Any number of variables may be AND-ed together. For Example: a && b && c && d . For this expression to evaluate to true, ALL of a , b , c and d must be true. Writing a table that lists every combination of inputs and outputs for this expression is left as an excersise for the reader. Boolean OR: This is used to check if one or more booleans are true . Usage: a || b (Here, a and b are boolean variables) This checks if either a or b is true . If one of them is, then the expression evaluates to true , else it evaluates to false . Every combination of inputs and outputs for a || b can be written in a table: a b a || b false false false false true true true false true true true true Tip The OR operation is not limited to just two variables. Any number of variables may be OR-ed together. For Example: a || b || c || d . For this expression to evaluate to true, only one of a , b , c and d needs to be true. Writing a table that lists every combination of inputs and outputs for this expression is left as an excersise for the reader. ANDs and ORs can be used together in the same expression. For example: (a || b) && c : for this expression to be true , either a or b and c must be true . a || (b && c) : for this expression to be true , either a must be true or b and c must be true simultaneously. Note If no brackets are used when writing these expressions the expression is evaluated left to right. This means that a || b && c || d is the same as ((a || b) && c) || d . Thus, to make it absolutely clear as to what you mean when writing a boolean expression, you should ALWAYS use brackets appropriately for clarity, even though it is not necessary to do so. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 void main () { int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; int c = 30 ; // this would assign true to d // because both a < b and c > d are true bool d = ( a < b ) && ( c > b ); // this would assign false to d // because c < b is not true d = ( a < b ) && ( c < b ); // this would assign true to d // because a < b is true d = ( a < b ) || ( c < b ); // this would assign false to d // because neither a > b nor c < b is true d = ( a > b ) || ( c < b ); } 6. Concatenation \u00b6 When two strings are joined to form a new string, it is known as concatenation. Other data types may also be concatenated with strings. For Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 void main () { string a = \"this is \" ; string b = \"string concatenation!\" ; int c = 11 ; float d = 5.5 ; bool e = true ; vector v = vector ( 1 , 2 , 3 ); // chats \"this is string concatenation! 11 5.5 1 (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)\" xsChatData ( a + b + \" \" + c + \" \" + d + \" \" + e + \" \" + v ); // remember, true and false are also represented by 1 and 0 respectively! } 7. Vector Operations \u00b6 Manipulating vectors in XS is done in a bit of a special way: Initialising a vector: We have already seen how this is done: vector v = vector ( 1 , 2 , 3 ); No Vars in Vector Initialisation For some reason, currently we cannot use variables to initialise vectors inside vector () ; This is probably a bug and will be fixed in future versions of XS. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 void main () { float x = 1.0 ; float y = 2.0 ; float z = 3.0 ; vector myVector = vector ( x , y , z ); // does not work, thxDE // alternatively, this would work: vector myVector = cInvalidVector ; myVector = xsVectorSetX ( myVector , x ); // sets the X component of the vector myVector = xsVectorSetY ( myVector , y ); // sets the y component of the vector myVector = xsVectorSetZ ( myVector , z ); // sets the z component of the vector // alternatively, even shorter way to do this: myVector = xsVectorSet ( 1 , 2 , 3 ); // here cInvalidVector is a pre-defined constant that XS recognises, it is the vector (-1, -1, -1) // Similarly, cOriginVector is a pre-defined constant that XS recognises, it is the vector (0, 0, 0) } Obtaining the X, Y, and Z components of a vector: The X, Y and Z components of a vector can be accessed as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 void main () { vector myVector = vector ( 1 , 2 , 3 ); float x = xsVectorGetX ( myVector ); // gives you the X component of the vector float y = xsVectorGetY ( myVector ); // gives you the y component of the vector float z = xsVectorGetZ ( myVector ); // gives you the z component of the vector } Setting the X, Y, and Z components of a vector individually: The X, Y and Z components of a vector can be set as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 void main () { vector myVector = vector ( 1 , 2 , 3 ); myVector = xsVectorSetX ( myVector , 10 ); // sets the X component of the vector myVector = xsVectorSetY ( myVector , 20 ); // sets the y component of the vector myVector = xsVectorSetZ ( myVector , 30 ); // sets the z component of the vector } Note that it is not necessary to change all 3 components at the same time, you can chose to only change one if you want to. Setting the entire vector: If you know that you want to change all 3 components of a vector, it can be done in one go instead of in 3 separate lines like above: 1 2 3 4 void main () { vector myVector = vector ( 1 , 2 , 3 ); myVector = xsVectorSet ( 10 , 20 , 30 ); } Obtaining the length of a vector: The length of a vector can be obtained as follows: 1 2 3 4 void main () { vector myVector = vector ( 1 , 2 , 3 ); float length = xsVectorLength ( myVector ); } Note Mathematically, the length of a vector is given by \\(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}\\) Normalizing a vector: The unit vector along the direction of the given vector is obtained by normalising it: 1 2 3 4 void main () { vector myVector = vector ( 1 , 2 , 3 ); vector unitVectorAlongMyVector = xsVectorNormalize ( myVector ); } Note Mathematically, the normalised vector is given by \\(\\left(\\cfrac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}, \\cfrac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}, \\cfrac{z}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}\\right)\\) 3.5. Flow Control Statements \u00b6 There are two types of flow control statements: 1. Conditionals \u00b6 There are times in life when you need to make decisions, and these decisions depend on certain conditions. For example, suppose that you are in a class, then a decision that you might have to make would be: \\(\\color{red} \\text{if} \\; \\color{yellow} \\text{you have a pen,} \\; \\color{red} \\text{then} \\; \\color{white} \\text{you can write on a piece of paper,} \\; \\color{red} \\text{else} \\; \\color{white} \\text{you borrow a pen}\\) Similarly, when writing a script, it might be needed to make decisions at some points in your code. Conditionals are decision making statements that can be used to chose which set of instructions to execute depending on given conditions. There are two types of conditionals suported by XS: The if else if statement An if else statement is used whenever you need your script to make decisions. It executes one set of instructions if a conditon is true or else it executes another set of instructions. Usage: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 void main () { int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; // if(boolean expression / variable / constant) if ( b > a ) { // if the above condition is true do: xsChatData ( \"does one thing\" ); xsChatData ( \"b > a confirmed!\" ); } else { // if the above condition is not true do: xsChatData ( \"does another thing\" ); xsChatData ( \"b <= a confirmed!\" ); } } Anything that is written inside curly braces {} is known as a \"block\" of code. A block of code written under an if is called the \"body\" of that if . If there is only one instruction that needs to be run inside an if or else then the curly braces {} can be omitted: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 void main () { int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; if ( b > a ) xsChatData ( \"does only one thing\" ); else xsChatData ( \"does only another thing\" ); } An if statement does not need to be followed by an else statement everytime 1 2 3 4 5 6 void main () { int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; if ( b > a ) xsChatData ( \"doesn't do anything if the conditon is false\" ); } What if you need to check multiple conditions and do separate things for each case? this is when you use an if else if statement! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 void main () { int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; if ( b > a ) xsChatData ( \"b > 20\" ); else if ( b == 20 ) xsChatData ( \"b == 20\" ); else xsChatData ( \"no condition is true\" ); } Note In the above example, both the ( b > a ) and ( b == 20 ) conditions are true. However, in an if else if statement, only one branch of instructions is ever executed. Which condition takes proiority is decided by what order you write them in. So in this case, \"b > 20\" will be chatted to the screen because that is the first condition which is true. Technically, whenever a condition becomes true and its branch of instructions are executed, all of the remaining conditions are skipped, and not even evaluated.

Loops \u00b6 There are times in life when you need to repeatedly keep doing something under certain conditions. For example, suppose that you are playing a game and you are stuck on a boss fight where you keep dying, something that you are doing might be: \\(\\color{red} \\text{while} \\; \\color{yellow} \\text{you have not defeated the boss,} \\; \\color{white} \\text{try again}\\) If you wanted to write out the times two table, you might do: \\(\\color{red} \\text{for} \\; \\color{yellow} \\text{every} \\; \\color{green} \\text{number} \\; \\color{red} \\text{between 1 and 10} \\; \\color{white} \\text{write }2\\times \\color{green} \\text{number}\\) Similarly, when writing a script, it might be needed to repeat certain parts of your code multiple times. Loops are statements that can be used to repeatedly execute a block of code given a condition is true. Sometimes the need arises to repeatedly execute the same statement or a statement where only a few things are changing. Loops are statements that allow us to do exactly that! There are two types of loops suported by XS: The while loop: A while statement repeatedly executes a block of code as long as (while) something is true . This process of repeatedly executing the same block of code is known as iteration! For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 void main () { int a = 0 ; while ( a < 10 ) { xsChatData ( \"a = \" + a ); a ++ ; // remember that a++ increases the value of a by one. // what would happen if you forgot to write a++? // your script would get stuck in an \"infinite\" loop // and the game would crash } } Practise Now that you are armed with the power of while , can you: Write a script that would chat to the screen the following pattern: 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16... up to 15 terms?

Firstly, a while loop can do all that a for loop can. However, a while loop is much slower than a for loop in performance! If it is possible, you should always stick to using for loops! A for loop also takes care of increasing or decreasing the variables of iteration, which means that you cannot accidently cause an \"infinite\" loop unlike a while loop. 3.6. Modular Programming \u00b6 1. Functions \u00b6 Lets say that you are watching TV. Every time you want to change the channel, you will use the same remote. It would be quite inconvenient if you had to make a new remote each time you wanted to change the channel. Similarly, when writing a script, you might want to write a piece of code that you need to re-use multiple times in different parts of your script. Functions allow us to do exactly this! A function is a piece of code that can input some values and use them to perform a given task. You have already seen a function before! xsChatData(string str); is actually a function which inputs a string and chats it in game. Another useful function is sqrt(float number); which calculates the square root of a value. Usage: float a = sqrt ( 4 ); This assigns the value 2.0 to a . An interesting thing to note here is that some functions \"give you back\" a value, like sqrt ( 5 ); will \"give you back\" \\(\\approx\\) 2.24 . This property that a function \"gives you back\" a value is formally known as the fact that the function \"returns\" a value. Not all functions do this, for example xsChatData ( \"my message\" ); simply displays that message on screen and does not return any value. A function can return a value of any data type. Each function also takes a set of inputs. xsChatData takes in a string, sqrt takes in a float. The set of inputs that a function can take are formally known as its \"parameters\". While these are inbuilt functions in XS that are provided to us to use to use directly, we can also define our own functions. This is how a function is defined in XS: Usage: 1 2 3 4 returnType functionName ( dataType parameter1 = defaultValue , dataType parameter2 = defaultValue ) { return ( value ); // value must be a data type that is the same as returnType } If it is not clear what this means, bare with this usage for a minute and see this example below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 // this is a custom function that returns the maximum of two integers. int max ( int a = 0 , int b = 0 ) { // the 'int' at the start tells us that this function // is going to return an integer value, // max is the name of the function // this function takes in two integer values, 'a' and 'b' // 'a' and 'b' are initialised to 0 by default, meaning if // the person using this function doesn't specify what values // to use for 'a' and 'b', 0 will be used. // a return statement tells the function to \"give you back\" whatever // value is specified. if ( a > b ) return ( a ); return ( b ); // wait, why have we not writte an else statement here? // a function ALWAYS terminates as soon as it encounters a 'return' // statement. this tells the function to stop doing whatever it is // doing and \"give you back\" the value specified. // this is why writing an else here is unecessary, because if // a > b then the 2nd return statement will never run in the first place } void main () { // this is how the function is then used: xsChatData ( \"max \" + max ( 10 , 20 )); // the values for the variables in the function are } // wait, isn't this 'main' also a function that we've been using so far? // yes it is! The 'void' signifies that it doesn't return any value // since there is nothing writting inside the brackets after 'main', // it does not take in any parameters either Function names follow the same laws and conventions that variable names do. A list of all inbuilt XS functions and their descriptions are provided in the Fucntion Reference section of this guide. 2. File Structure \u00b6 When you write an XS Script, it is a good idea to group your functions and put them into an appropriately named file. For example, if you have an XS Script that does calculations with vectors, like adding, subtracting, dot product or cross product, or other vector operations, you might want to use it in more than on XS Script. Copying all the functions in every XS Script that you want to use them in is tedious and is considered a bad programming practise. What we can do instead is write another XS Script named \"VectorOperations.xs\" and then \"call\" this script in every other script where vector operations are required. For Example: If I have two files, test.xs and VectorOperations.xs in the same folder, then: test.xs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 include \"./VectorOperations.xs\" ; // \"./VectorOperations.xs\" is the relative path of the // VectorOperations.xs file from the text.xs file. // This can also be the absolute path of a file. // If you do not know what absolute/relative paths are, // a quick google search will tell you more about them. void main () { vector a = vector ( 1 , 2 , 3 ); vector b = vector ( 3 , 2 , 1 ); xsChatData ( \"dot: \" + dotProduct ( a , b )); xsChatData ( \"cross: \" + crossProduct ( a , b )); xsChatData ( \"add: \" + add ( a , b )); } VectorOperations.xs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 int dotProduct ( vector a = cInvalidVector , vector b = cInvalidVector ) { return ( xsVectorGetX ( a ) * xsVectorGetX ( b ) + xsVectorGetY ( a ) * xsVectorGetY ( b ) + xsVectorGetZ ( a ) * xsVectorGetZ ( b )); } vector crossProduct ( vector a = cInvalidVector , vector b = cInvalidVector ) { vector product = cInvalidVector ; product = xsVectorSetX ( product , xsVectorGetY ( a ) * xsVectorGetZ ( b ) - xsVectorGetZ ( a ) * xsVectorGetY ( b )); product = xsVectorSetY ( product , 0 - xsVectorGetX ( a ) * xsVectorGetZ ( b ) + xsVectorGetZ ( a ) * xsVectorGetX ( b )); product = xsVectorSetZ ( product , xsVectorGetX ( a ) * xsVectorGetY ( b ) - xsVectorGetY ( a ) * xsVectorGetX ( b )); return ( product ); } vector add ( vector a = cInvalidVector , vector b = cInvalidVector ) { vector addition = cInvalidVector ; addition = xsVectorSetX ( addition , xsVectorGetX ( a ) + xsVectorGetX ( b )); addition = xsVectorSetY ( addition , xsVectorGetY ( a ) + xsVectorGetY ( b )); addition = xsVectorSetZ ( addition , xsVectorGetZ ( a ) + xsVectorGetZ ( b )); return ( addition ); } This way, for every file that you need to use \"VectorOperations.xs\" in, you just need to write include \"/relative/or/absolute/path/to/file\" ; and you can use all the functions that you wrote in it in that file as well! Code that is written like this, where: Every separate operation is in its own function Every group of similar functions is in their own file, Is known as modular code! Writing code like this is considered a very very good programming practise. This way, others reading your code can easily read, and understand your code and get the idea of the big picture! However... Currently there is a bug (thxDE 11) due to which XS Scripts are not properly transfered to other players in the lobby. For now, a workaround is to manually give everyone the XS Scripts needed. 3.7. Scope of a Variable \u00b6 Every variable has a scope, i.e. an \"area\" of the code where it can be used. For example, you cannot use a variable before it has been initialised, that doesn't make sense! 1 2 3 4 void main () { a ++ ; // wait, a doesn't exist yet! you cannot do this. int a = 10 ; } Similarly, Variables initialised inside one function can only be used in that particular function, and do not exist outside of them. These kinds of variables are known as local variables. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 void main () { int a = 10 ; } void anotherFunction () { a ++ ; // wait, a doesn't exist inside another! you cannot do this. // you can actually declare another variable named a inside of another: int a = 44 ; // this a is completely different and independent from the a in main(); } What if you want a variable that is shared between functions? A variable like this must be declared outside of all functions. Such a variable is known as a global variable. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 int a = 10 ; void main () { a ++ ; } void anotherFunction () { a ++ ; } 3.8. Arrays \u00b6 An array is a data structure that allows you to make ordered, numbered lists of one kind of data type. In every numbered list, each element is identified using its number. This number is known as an index. If a is an array of integers, then it might looks something like this: Index Value 0 23 1 4 2 42 3 32 4 92 The index is what identifies elements in an array and indices for each array always starts from 0. For example: a [ 2 ] is 42 . While in most programming languages a [ 2 ] is the way to access elements in an array, that is not how it is done in XS. Lets look at how arrays are used in XS: For creating arrays, the following functions are used for the relevant data type: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 // creates a sized and named integer array, with every value // initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID. int xsArrayCreateInt ( int size , int defaultValue , string name ) // creates a sized and named float array, with every value // initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID. int xsArrayCreateFloat ( int size , float defaultValue , string name ) // creates a sized and named boolean array, with every value // initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID. int xsArrayCreateBool ( int size , bool defaultValue , string name ) // creates a sized and named string array, with every value // initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID. int xsArrayCreateString ( int size , string defaultValue , string name ) // creates a sized and named vector array, with every value // initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID. int xsArrayCreateVector ( int size , vector defaultValue , string name ) For the name of the array, any string may be used but all names must be unique All of these functions return an integer which is the ID of the array that you just created. This ID is used to perform other operations on the array. You want to store this integer in a variable that is named apty so that you can use the array later. To get a value at a specific index from an array, we use the following functions for the relevant data types: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 // returns an integer from the specified index of the specified array int xsArrayGetInt ( int arrayID , int index ) // returns a float from the specified index of the specified array float xsArrayGetFloat ( int arrayID , int index ) // returns a boolean from the specified index of the specified array bool xsArrayGetBool ( int arrayID , int index ) // returns a string from the specified index of the specified array string xsArrayGetString ( int arrayID , int index ) // returns a vector from the specified index of the specified array vector xsArrayGetVector ( int arrayID , int index ) If you ever try to access values in arrays that dont exist (invalid arrayID) or values at indices that dont exist (negative indices or indices more than the length of the array) then the default values for the data types are returned. These are: 1 2 3 4 5 int defaultValue = -1 float defaultValue = -1.0 bool defaultValue = false string defaultValue = \"\" vector defaultValue = vector ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) To set a value at a specific index in an array, we use the following functions for the relevant data types: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 // Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array. int xsArraySetInt ( int arrayID , int index , int value ) // Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array. int xsArraySetFloat ( int arrayID , int index , float value ) // Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array. int xsArraySetBool ( int arrayID , int index , bool value ) // Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array. int xsArraySetString ( int arrayID , int index , string value ) // Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array. int xsArraySetVector ( int arrayID , int index , vector value ) Note that these Set functions return a value of 1 every time, however this does not need to be stored in a variable. To change the size of an array 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 // Resize the specified array. int xsArrayResizeInt ( int arrayID , int newSize ) // Resize the specified array. int xsArrayResizeFloat ( int arrayID , int newSize ) // Resize the specified array. int xsArrayResizeBool ( int arrayID , int newSize ) // Resize the specified array. int xsArrayResizeString ( int arrayID , int newSize ) // Resize the specified array. int xsArrayResizeVector ( int arrayID , int newSize ) Note that these Resize functions return a value of 1 every time, however this does not need to be stored in a variable. int xsArrayGetSize ( int arrayID ) is also a useful array function that returns the size of the specified array. 3.9. Type Casting \u00b6 Type casting is when a value of one data type is \"transformed\" into a value of another, similar data type. This is like taking an object stored in one type of container and putting it into another. For example, When you try to store an int in a float , it would work without any issues. It is similar to storing water in a bottle and then putting the water from that bottle into a flask. When you try to store a float in an int however, the fractional part of the float is lost! This is like trying to put water from a water bottle into a paper bag. Some of the water will leak out! There are two kinds of type casting: Implicit Type Casting Implicit type casting is done automatically by the script (hence implicit) when you assign one type of value to another, similar data type. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 void main () { int a = 5 ; float b = 3.9 ; bool c = true ; // implicit type casting: int d = c ; // remember, true is 1 and false is 0 float e = c ; string f = \"\" + c ; // just string f = c; will not work // when type casting a float to an int, the fractional part of the number is lost! // note that it is not rounded off, 3.9 would become 3 after type casting int = b ; // anything other than a 0 gives true for a bool bool = b ; string = \"\" + b ; float g = a ; // anything other than a 0 gives true for bool bool h = a ; string i = \"\" + a ; } Explicit Type Casting Explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer (hence explicit). For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 void main () { float a = 5.5 ; float b = ( int ) a ; // assigns 5.0 to b float c = ( int ) 22.5 ; // assigns 22.0 to c } 4. Rules \u00b6 A rule is a block of code that can be set to repeatedly execute at set intervals throughout the duration of the game. A rule is always initialised outside of a function. Its usage looks like: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 rule ruleName // This is the name of the rule. Follows same naming laws as variables. active / inactive // this is the initial state of the rule, active means that runs by default // and inactive means that it wont run by default. // this is similar to how triggers work when you enable/disable them. group groupName // the group that this rule belongs to. Follows same naming laws as variables. minInterval < int > // the minimum time interval that must pass before the block is executed again maxInterval < int > // the maximum time interval that may pass before the block has to be executed again highFrequency // Loop the rule 60 times every physical second (this is independant of inagme speed) // Only one of \"highFrequency\" or \"minInterval\" and \"maxInterval\" are used. Both cannot be used together runImmediately // It is currently unknown as to what this option does priority < int > // rules are executed in order of their descending priority { // code to execute } Example Usages: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 int a = 0 ; // This rule prints the value of a every 2 seconds. rule chatTheValueOfA active minInterval 2 maxInterval 2 group chatGroup { xsChatData ( \"a = \" + a ); a ++ ; } There are a lot of built in XS functions that can interact with rules. Check the Rules Section of this guide. The variable cActivationTime , when used inside the block of a rule, gives the time of activation of the rule in seconds. With that, you now know everything that is currently known to work with XS Scripts.

What is XS?"},{"location":"general/xs/beginner/#2-using-an-xs","text":"To use an XS: Make sure you can see file extensions. That means that every file on your computer should have a name that looks something like filename.ext . If you can see file extensions, then proceed to step 2. If not, then follow these steps: Press + E Click View right at the top. On the right side of the panel that appears, there will be an option called File Name Extensions . Check this option if it is not already checked. Navigate to the folder: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\AoE2DE\\resources\\_common\\xs There should be 2 files in this folder already, called Constants.xs and xs.txt . In here, create a new file with any name ending with .xs . For example, the file can be called filename.xs default0.xs There may be an additional file called default0.xs . Never write code in this file as this is a temporary file and can be overwritten by the game. The file Constants.xs contains a list of constants that can be used in any XS Script, using their name. They are essentially constants that the XS language pre-defines for you. Now open this file that you just created in your favourite text/code editor! If you don't have one already, using Visual Studio Code (VSC) is recommended. A VSC Extension for syntax highlighting and code auto completion for AoE XS Scripting can be found here To begin with using XS, write this basic code in the file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 // Anything that is written after a double front slash is a comment. // A comment is a line that is ignored when running the script. // comments are useful for explaining your code to others and // more importantly, your future self. // writing comments is a good habit because it helps you understand your // own code better. // you will see comments widely used in this guide, to explain almost // every bit of code that you see // do note though, that even though commenting is a good practise, // over commenting code is a worse thing to do. Only comment stuff // that really needs commenting! /* Anything enclosed by a front slash and asterisk pair is a multi line comment */ // Here, you are creating a function that is called 'main'. void main () { // this line says that you have an integer called 'a' that has a value of 10. // note that almost every statement in XS is ended with a semi colon, // just like in english we use periods to indicate the end of a sentence. int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; // this line says that you make a new integer called 'c' and it is the sum of 'a' and 'b'. int c = a + b ; // this line will show in the game chat the value of 'c'.

Programming Concepts:"},{"location":"general/xs/beginner/#31-constants","text":"To do anything in an XS Script, we need constants. Any value that remains the same throughout the execution of the script is known as a constant. Quite literally, it remains constant throughout the execution of then script. For example, 10 is a constant. Every number is a constant.","title":"3.1. Constants"},{"location":"general/xs/beginner/#32-variables","text":"Variables are like boxes that are used to store constants. Variables are values that can change during the execution of the script! Think about it this way, if a variable is a box that stores a constant, that constant can be taken out and another one can be put in. Quite literally, it is a variable (it may change!). For example, the script that we saw earlier uses 3 variables, called a b and c . 1 2 3 4 5 6 void main () { int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; int c = a + b ; xsChatData ( \"\" + c ); } Some questions that you might have now are: What is this int that preceeds the variable's name? That is the \"data type\" of the variable! What is a data type you ask? Every variable in a script has a data type, that is, it tells you what kind of value is stored in the variable. Think about it this way, if you want to store water, you need to specify that it must be stored in a bottle. Isn't that kind of obvious you might say? While to a human it might be obvious, a computer is a dumb machine. It does not know what to do unless you tell it, it is like a baby who must be spoonfed every tiny detail and instruction for it to work properly. What other types of data types are there? There are a total of 5 data types supported by XS, they are: Integer ( int ) You have seen an int before, an integer is a data type that stores an integer quantity. An integer quantity may be negative, positive, or zero. It never has any fractional or decimal parts (for example, an integer never has 0.5 ). Usage: int a = 10 ; This declares a variable of type int called a with a value of 10 Floating Point ( float ) A float is a data type that can store values with fractional parts or decimals. For example 1.5 is a floating point value. Usage: float a = 3.14159 ; This declares a variable of type float called a with a value of 3.14159 Why would you ever use an int then? The reason is because computers take longer to perform calculations with floats! If you know that your calculation will not involve fractional values and decimals, you should always use an integer instead of a floating point value Boolean ( bool ) A bool is a data type, that can only store one of two different values, true or false . Any yes or no question is a boolean question in some sense, because there are only two answers, yes or no. Boolean variables are super important for conditions, which we will be looking at later. Usage: bool a = true ; This declares a variable of type bool called a with a value of true Note A value of true is also indicated by 1 and a value of false is also indicated by 0 . String ( string ) A string is a word, a phrase or a sentence. A string is always enclosed by double quotes. Usage: string a = \"this is a string! yay\" ; This declares a variable of type string called a with a value of \"this is a string! yay\" Vector ( vector ) A vector is a variable that can store the coordinates of a point ( x , y , z ) . If you don't know what that means, just take it as a variable that stores three different float values. The first value is called the \"X component\", the second value is called the \"Y component\" and the last value is called the \"Z component\". Usage vector v = vector ( 1.2 , 2.3 ., 3.2 ); This declares a variable of type vector called v that represents a point with coordinates ( 1.2 , 2.3 , 3.2 ) . Remember that your variable names can be almost anything! However, this does not mean that you should just use single letters or alphabets for variable names. Variable names should be chosen such that they represent, or hint to what the purpose of the variable is. Naming your variables such that they make intuitive sense is a good programming practise. How do I actually change a variable? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 void main () { int my_var = 20 ; // you only need to specify the data type of a variable once // when it is created. This \"first time\" creation is known // as \"variable declaration\" or \"initialisation\". // This way, when you change the value of the variable // you don't need to say that it is an integer again my_var = 30 ; // you can set variables equal to each other as well. int my_var2 = my_var ; // note that a variable can only be changed to another value // of a similar data type. This means that this following line // is WRONG: my_var = \"this is a string\" ; // trying to initialise a variable without a data type is also // WRONG: my_var3 = \"this string cannot be initalised since the data type is missing!\" ; float my_var4 = my_var ; } This process of changing the value that a variable stores is called \"assignment\". So in the above example, We first initalise my_var to 20 . Then we assign a value of 30 to my var . Then we initialise another variable called my_var2 whose value is equal to the value of my_var . Then we try to assign the string \"this is a string\" to my_var but remember that my_var is an integer, and it is not capable of storing a string, so this will actually give you an error. Think about it this way, you cannot put water in a paper bag, paper bags are not meant to store water! There is an exception to this rule: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 void main () { int a = 10 ; float b = 20.5 ; // the only cases where you can assign one type of data to another // is when going from integers to floats float c = a ; // this will show 10.0 in game chat xsChatData ( \"\" + c ); // or when going from floats to integers. // However, since integers cannot store the fractional part, // it is discarded! int d = b ; // this will show 20 in game chat xsChatData ( \"\" + d ); } Lastly, we try to initialise a new variable called my_var3 but we have not specified a data type! This will also give you an error. Think about it this way, if you want to store water, you need to specify if you want to use a paper bag or a water bottle. Can I make a variable whoes value cannot be changed? Yes! initialising a variable with the word const will make it a constant, and you won't be able to change its values. Usage: const int a = 10 ; If you now try to change the value of a , you will get an error.","title":"3.2. Variables"},{"location":"general/xs/beginner/#33-variable-naming-rules-and-conventions","text":"There are some rules that must be followed when naming a variable. They are: You can only use letters, numbers and underscores to name your variables. A variable name cannot start with a number. Variable names are CaSe SeNsItIvE . This means that a and A are two different variable names! Variable names must not be keywords. A keyword is a reserved word in any programming language that has a special meaning! For example, int is a keyword in XS because it is used to declare a variable of the int data type. While these are the only laws that you absolutely must follow, there are some conventions or unwritten rules that all programmers agree to follow to make their code more readable, and more clear. When you are writing a variable name that is just one word, it is conventional to write it in all small letters. For example int radius = 10 ; or string name = \"Alian713\" ; . When you are writing a variable name that consists of more than one word, then it is conventional to write it in a special case known as \"camel case\". Camel case is where the first letter of every word is capitalised except the first word. For Example: float gearRatio = 2.2 ; or string firstName = \"Bruce\" ; or string lastName = \"Wayne\" ; . When you are writing a variable that is supposed to just store the value of a constant, one which you never intend to change, it is conventional to use capital letters and words are separated by underscores. For example: float PI = 3.14159 ; or float GOLDEN_RATIO = 1.61803 ; . Variable names should be precise and mnemonic. That is, they should indicate to a casual programmer their purpose. Usage of single letter variable names is discouraged unless it is a throwaway or temporary variable.","title":"3.3.

Operations"},{"location":"general/xs/beginner/#1-arithmetic-operations","text":"The most obvious thing that we can do with numbers, is do arithmetic with them. XS Scripts support the following five arithmetic operations: Addition: a+b this gives you the sum of two variables, a and b . for example, Subtraction: a-b this gives you the difference of two variables, a from b . Multiplication: a*b this gives you the product of two variables, a and b . For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 void main () { int a = 69 ; int b = 420 ; // this will chat 489 in game (69+420 = 489) xsChatData ( \"result of 420+69 = \" + ( a + b )); // this will chat 351 in game (420-69 = 351) xsChatData ( \"result of 420-69 = \" + ( b - a )); // this will chat 28980 in game (420*69 = 28980) xsChatData ( \"result of 420*69 = \" + ( a * b )); } Division: a/b this gives you the division of a by b . Note that in programming, division is weird with how it works for integers and floats: For int , it performs what we call \"integer division\": 5 / 2 = 2 17 / 6 = 2 Basically, you round down any fractional part to your answer when you do normal division for integers. For float , it performs regular division as you would expect: 5.0 / 2.0 = 2.5 17.0 / 6.0 = 2.83333 This gives you the exact result of division. What if you mix a float and an int ? In that case, regular division is used. Modulo: a%b this gives you the remainder when dividing a by b . DataType of Result of Operation Due to a bug at the moment, the data type of the answer of any operation is decided by the first number used in the operation. This means that 9 * 5.5 evaluates to 49 instead of 49.5 . However, 5.5 * 9 will correctly evaluate to 49.5 . Note that this is a bug in XS itself and will probably be fixed in a future update For Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 void main () { // this will chat 2 in game (5/2 = 2.5 but remember, this is integer division! so round down to 2) xsChatData ( \"result of 5/2 = \" + ( 5 / 2 )); // this will chat 2 in game (17/6 = 2.833 but remember, this is integer division! so round down to 2) xsChatData ( \"result of 17/6 = \" + ( 17 / 6 )); // this will chat 2.5 in game (since the numerator is a float, float division will give the exact value) xsChatData ( \"result of 5.0/2 = \" + ( 5.0 / 2 )); // this will chat 2 in game (since the numerator is an int, integer division will give the exact value) xsChatData ( \"result of 5/2.0 = \" + ( 5 / 2.0 )); // this will chat 5 in game (17%6 = 5) xsChatData ( \"result of 17%6 = \" + ( 17 % 6 )); // this should chat 0.5 in game (2.5%1 = 0.5) xsChatData ( \"result of 17%6 = \" + ( 2.5 % 1 )); // Due to a bug at the moment, this will actually show 0.0 // Modulo on fractions does not work properly at this time. } Also Additionally, when testing stuff using xsChatData , be wary of some quirks that this has: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 void main () { // Note that chat data does not send the same thing multiple consecutively // which means if two calculations have the same result, only the first // one is shown xsChatData ( \"this is shown only once\" ); xsChatData ( \"this is shown only once\" ); xsChatData ( \"this is shown only once\" ); xsChatData ( \"this is shown only once\" ); xsChatData ( \"this is shown twice\" ); xsChatData ( \"this will make them non consecutive\" ); xsChatData ( \"this is shown twice\" ); } The way around this is to use a unique number or letter at the start of every message so that even if the content of the message is the same, the number is different so that it gets shown the right amount of times","title":"1.

Remember, a boolean data type can either be true or false , it does exactly this! Thus, the answers to all relational operations give you boolean values. a < b This checks if the number a is lesser than b . If it is, then the expression evaluates to true , else it evaluates to false . For example: 1 2 3 // this will print \"5 < 10 : 1\" xsChatData ( \"5 < 10 : \" + ( 5 <> 10 )); // remember, in programming, 1 is the same as true a > b This checks if the number a is greater than b .

Usage: a && b (Here, a and b are boolean variables) This checks if both a AND b are true . If they are, the expression evaluates to true , otherwise it evaluates to false . Every combination of inputs and outputs for a && b can be written in a table: a b a && b false false false false true false true false false true true true Tip The AND operation is not limited to just two variables. Any number of variables may be AND-ed together. For Example: a && b && c && d . For this expression to evaluate to true, ALL of a , b , c and d must be true. Writing a table that lists every combination of inputs and outputs for this expression is left as an excersise for the reader. Boolean OR: This is used to check if one or more booleans are true . Usage: a || b (Here, a and b are boolean variables) This checks if either a or b is true . If one of them is, then the expression evaluates to true , else it evaluates to false . Every combination of inputs and outputs for a || b can be written in a table: a b a || b false false false false true true true false true true true true Tip The OR operation is not limited to just two variables. Any number of variables may be OR-ed together. For Example: a || b || c || d . For this expression to evaluate to true, only one of a , b , c and d needs to be true. Writing a table that lists every combination of inputs and outputs for this expression is left as an excersise for the reader. ANDs and ORs can be used together in the same expression. For example: (a || b) && c : for this expression to be true , either a or b and c must be true . a || (b && c) : for this expression to be true , either a must be true or b and c must be true simultaneously. Note If no brackets are used when writing these expressions the expression is evaluated left to right. This means that a || b && c || d is the same as ((a || b) && c) || d . Thus, to make it absolutely clear as to what you mean when writing a boolean expression, you should ALWAYS use brackets appropriately for clarity, even though it is not necessary to do so.

Conditionals are decision making statements that can be used to chose which set of instructions to execute depending on given conditions. There are two types of conditionals suported by XS: The if else if statement An if else statement is used whenever you need your script to make decisions. It executes one set of instructions if a conditon is true or else it executes another set of instructions. Usage: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 void main () { int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; // if(boolean expression / variable / constant) if ( b > a ) { // if the above condition is true do: xsChatData ( \"does one thing\" ); xsChatData ( \"b > a confirmed!\" ); } else { // if the above condition is not true do: xsChatData ( \"does another thing\" ); xsChatData ( \"b <= a confirmed!\" ); } } Anything that is written inside curly braces {} is known as a \"block\" of code. A block of code written under an if is called the \"body\" of that if . If there is only one instruction that needs to be run inside an if or else then the curly braces {} can be omitted: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 void main () { int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; if ( b > a ) xsChatData ( \"does only one thing\" ); else xsChatData ( \"does only another thing\" ); } An if statement does not need to be followed by an else statement everytime 1 2 3 4 5 6 void main () { int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; if ( b > a ) xsChatData ( \"doesn't do anything if the conditon is false\" ); } What if you need to check multiple conditions and do separate things for each case? this is when you use an if else if statement! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 void main () { int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; if ( b > a ) xsChatData ( \"b > 20\" ); else if ( b == 20 ) xsChatData ( \"b == 20\" ); else xsChatData ( \"no condition is true\" ); } Note In the above example, both the ( b > a ) and ( b == 20 ) conditions are true. However, in an if else if statement, only one branch of instructions is ever executed. Which condition takes proiority is decided by what order you write them in. So in this case, \"b > 20\" will be chatted to the screen because that is the first condition which is true. Technically, whenever a condition becomes true and its branch of instructions are executed, all of the remaining conditions are skipped, and not even evaluated.

Loops are statements that can be used to repeatedly execute a block of code given a condition is true. Sometimes the need arises to repeatedly execute the same statement or a statement where only a few things are changing. Loops are statements that allow us to do exactly that!

It would be quite inconvenient if you had to make a new remote each time you wanted to change the channel. Similarly, when writing a script, you might want to write a piece of code that you need to re-use multiple times in different parts of your script. Functions allow us to do exactly this! A function is a piece of code that can input some values and use them to perform a given task. You have already seen a function before! xsChatData(string str); is actually a function which inputs a string and chats it in game. Another useful function is sqrt(float number); which calculates the square root of a value. Usage: float a = sqrt ( 4 ); This assigns the value 2.0 to a . An interesting thing to note here is that some functions \"give you back\" a value, like sqrt ( 5 ); will \"give you back\" \\(\\approx\\) 2.24 . This property that a function \"gives you back\" a value is formally known as the fact that the function \"returns\" a value. Not all functions do this, for example xsChatData ( \"my message\" ); simply displays that message on screen and does not return any value. A function can return a value of any data type. Each function also takes a set of inputs. xsChatData takes in a string, sqrt takes in a float. The set of inputs that a function can take are formally known as its \"parameters\". While these are inbuilt functions in XS that are provided to us to use to use directly, we can also define our own functions. This is how a function is defined in XS: Usage: 1 2 3 4 returnType functionName ( dataType parameter1 = defaultValue , dataType parameter2 = defaultValue ) { return ( value ); // value must be a data type that is the same as returnType } If it is not clear what this means, bare with this usage for a minute and see this example below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 // this is a custom function that returns the maximum of two integers. int max ( int a = 0 , int b = 0 ) { // the 'int' at the start tells us that this function // is going to return an integer value, // max is the name of the function // this function takes in two integer values, 'a' and 'b' // 'a' and 'b' are initialised to 0 by default, meaning if // the person using this function doesn't specify what values // to use for 'a' and 'b', 0 will be used. // a return statement tells the function to \"give you back\" whatever // value is specified. if ( a > b ) return ( a ); return ( b ); // wait, why have we not writte an else statement here? // a function ALWAYS terminates as soon as it encounters a 'return' // statement. this tells the function to stop doing whatever it is // doing and \"give you back\" the value specified. // this is why writing an else here is unecessary, because if // a > b then the 2nd return statement will never run in the first place } void main () { // this is how the function is then used: xsChatData ( \"max \" + max ( 10 , 20 )); // the values for the variables in the function are } // wait, isn't this 'main' also a function that we've been using so far? // yes it is!

Copying all the functions in every XS Script that you want to use them in is tedious and is considered a bad programming practise. What we can do instead is write another XS Script named \"VectorOperations.xs\" and then \"call\" this script in every other script where vector operations are required.

Code that is written like this, where: Every separate operation is in its own function Every group of similar functions is in their own file, Is known as modular code! Writing code like this is considered a very very good programming practise. This way, others reading your code can easily read, and understand your code and get the idea of the big picture!

If a is an array of integers, then it might looks something like this: Index Value 0 23 1 4 2 42 3 32 4 92 The index is what identifies elements in an array and indices for each array always starts from 0. For example: a [ 2 ] is 42 . While in most programming languages a [ 2 ] is the way to access elements in an array, that is not how it is done in XS. Lets look at how arrays are used in XS: For creating arrays, the following functions are used for the relevant data type: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 // creates a sized and named integer array, with every value // initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID. int xsArrayCreateInt ( int size , int defaultValue , string name ) // creates a sized and named float array, with every value // initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID. int xsArrayCreateFloat ( int size , float defaultValue , string name ) // creates a sized and named boolean array, with every value // initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID. int xsArrayCreateBool ( int size , bool defaultValue , string name ) // creates a sized and named string array, with every value // initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID. int xsArrayCreateString ( int size , string defaultValue , string name ) // creates a sized and named vector array, with every value // initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID. int xsArrayCreateVector ( int size , vector defaultValue , string name ) For the name of the array, any string may be used but all names must be unique All of these functions return an integer which is the ID of the array that you just created. This ID is used to perform other operations on the array. You want to store this integer in a variable that is named apty so that you can use the array later. To get a value at a specific index from an array, we use the following functions for the relevant data types: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 // returns an integer from the specified index of the specified array int xsArrayGetInt ( int arrayID , int index ) // returns a float from the specified index of the specified array float xsArrayGetFloat ( int arrayID , int index ) // returns a boolean from the specified index of the specified array bool xsArrayGetBool ( int arrayID , int index ) // returns a string from the specified index of the specified array string xsArrayGetString ( int arrayID , int index ) // returns a vector from the specified index of the specified array vector xsArrayGetVector ( int arrayID , int index ) If you ever try to access values in arrays that dont exist (invalid arrayID) or values at indices that dont exist (negative indices or indices more than the length of the array) then the default values for the data types are returned. These are: 1 2 3 4 5 int defaultValue = -1 float defaultValue = -1.0 bool defaultValue = false string defaultValue = \"\" vector defaultValue = vector ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) To set a value at a specific index in an array, we use the following functions for the relevant data types: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 // Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array. int xsArraySetInt ( int arrayID , int index , int value ) // Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array. int xsArraySetFloat ( int arrayID , int index , float value ) // Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array. int xsArraySetBool ( int arrayID , int index , bool value ) // Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array. int xsArraySetString ( int arrayID , int index , string value ) // Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array. int xsArraySetVector ( int arrayID , int index , vector value ) Note that these Set functions return a value of 1 every time, however this does not need to be stored in a variable.

Arrays"},{"location":"general/xs/beginner/#39-type-casting","text":"Type casting is when a value of one data type is \"transformed\" into a value of another, similar data type. This is like taking an object stored in one type of container and putting it into another. For example, When you try to store an int in a float , it would work without any issues. It is similar to storing water in a bottle and then putting the water from that bottle into a flask. When you try to store a float in an int however, the fractional part of the float is lost! This is like trying to put water from a water bottle into a paper bag. Some of the water will leak out! There are two kinds of type casting: Implicit Type Casting Implicit type casting is done automatically by the script (hence implicit) when you assign one type of value to another, similar data type. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 void main () { int a = 5 ; float b = 3.9 ; bool c = true ; // implicit type casting: int d = c ; // remember, true is 1 and false is 0 float e = c ; string f = \"\" + c ; // just string f = c; will not work // when type casting a float to an int, the fractional part of the number is lost! // note that it is not rounded off, 3.9 would become 3 after type casting int = b ; // anything other than a 0 gives true for a bool bool = b ; string = \"\" + b ; float g = a ; // anything other than a 0 gives true for bool bool h = a ; string i = \"\" + a ; } Explicit Type Casting Explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer (hence explicit). For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 void main () { float a = 5.5 ; float b = ( int ) a ; // assigns 5.0 to b float c = ( int ) 22.5 ; // assigns 22.0 to c }","title":"3.9.

Check the Rules Section of this guide. The variable cActivationTime , when used inside the block of a rule, gives the time of activation of the rule in seconds. With that, you now know everything that is currently known to work with XS Scripts. Good luck and have fun creating awesome maps!","title":"4. Rules"},{"location":"general/xs/bugs/","text":"Known Bugs And Quirks In XS Scripting \u00b6 Written by: Alian713 This page is a list of known bugs, quirks and weird behaviour in XS Scripting. All the shown code can be directly copy pasted into any XS file to reproduce the bugs/effects documented. Any new bugs discovered will be added to the list. This list will also be updated with each AoEII:DE update, removing any bugs that get fixed. If you know of a bug that is not documented here, or if a bug listed here is actually fixed in the indicated game version, reach out to the authors of this guide! Check the About page for relevant information about the authors. Game Version: 101.101.54480.0 7463742 Last Updated: 07.10.2021 Game Platform: Steam OS: Windows 10 Bugs \u00b6 1. xsEffectAmount Related Crashes \u00b6 Description: When an attribute for a player that is not present in the game is modified, a crash occurs Expected Behaviour: Expressions and variables should be able to be used when initialising Vectors. Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 void main () { xsEffectAmount ( cSetAttribute , 1071 , cAmountFirstStorage , current_pop - 250 , 8 ); // if the game is not an 8 player game, this will crash } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played with less than 8 players, a crash will occur 2. xsEffectAmount effect cMulAttribute with attribute cAttack/cArmor \u00b6 Description: When using xsEffectAmount and cMulAttribute to modify cAttack/cArmor , the change is not calculated correctly Expected Behaviour: Expected behaviour is demonstrated using the following example: Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 void main () { const int cGenghisKhan = 731 ; const int cBasePierce = 3 ; // Genghis Khan has 25 attack on the base pierce class by default xsEffectAmount ( cMulAttribute , cGenghisKhan , cAttack , cBasePierce * 256 + 2 ); // this should multiply the attack by 2 and hence set it to 50, but it actually sets it to 1. } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, The attack of the Genghis Khan unit is shown as 25-24. It should be 25+25 instead! 3. Script Call A Function With Parameters \u00b6 Description: When a function that takes arguments is defined in an XS file is called using script call, all XS execution stops. No syntax errors are shown, this happens completely silently Expected Behaviour: Function call works as expected, without crashing the entirety of XS execution Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 void test ( int a = 0 , int b = 0 ) { xsChatData ( \"this is var a: %d\" , a ); xsChatData ( \"this is var b: %d\" , b ); } Include the script in the scenario, and create a trigger with a script call condition/effect Type test ( 1 , 2 ) ; in the message box for the script call When the scenario is played, no text is chatted to the screen, execution fails silently 4. Outputs Of Operations Are Of The Wrong Data Type \u00b6 Description: The output type of an operation is determined by the first operand a*b . For example: 9 * 5.5 evaluates to 49 and not 49.5 . However, the expression 5.5 * 9 gives the correct result. Expected Behaviour: Both the expressions in the above example should yield the same result. Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 void main () { int a = 7 ; float b = 1.1 ; // expected `7/1.1 = 6.363636` but actually // prints `7/1.1 = 6` xsChatData ( \"7/1.1 = \" + a / b ); } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, 6.363636 should have been chatted to the screen, but instead 6 is shown on the screen. 5. Modulo Operator Does Not Work Properly With Floating Point Values \u00b6 Description: Using the modulo operator on floats does not return the fractional part of the answer. Expected Behaviour: Using the modulo operator on a float value should correctly return the fractional part of the remainder. Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 void main () { // expected `5.5 mod 1 = 0.500000` but actually // prints `5.5 mod 1 = 0.000000` xsChatData ( \"5.5 mod 1 = \" + ( 5.5 % 1 )); } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, 0.500000 should be chatted to the screen, but instaed 0.000000 is shown. 6. Function Parameters And Return Statements Do Not Implicitly Type Cast \u00b6 Description: Passing an int to a function parameter that is supposed to take in a float value gets used as an int and is not type casted. Similarly, values returned from a function are not type casted to the function's return type. For example, if an int is returned in a function that is supposed to return a float , it will just return the int as is without type casting into float Expected Behaviour: Values that are passed to/returned from a function should be correctly type casted. Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 float test ( float a = -1 ) { // keeping in mind the previous bug, // 5*5.5 evaluates to 27 (an int) // 27/2 then evaluates to 13 (an int) return ( a * 5.5 / 2 ); // expected to return `13.750000` } void main () { // expected `test = 13.7500000` // prints `test = 13` xsChatData ( \"test = \" + test ( 5 )); // passed 5 for the argument which should // get type casted into a float but it // actually does not. // note that this function is supposed to return a float // but it actually returns an integer! } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, 13.750000 should be chatted to the screen, but 13 is shown instead 7. Static Variables In Recursive Functions \u00b6 Description: If a static variable is declared inside a recursive function, its value cannot be changed Expected Behaviour: static variables inside recursive functions should behave normally like they do in C++ Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 int prevent_infinite_recursion = 1 ; void test () { static int a = 1 ; xsChatData ( \"a is \" + a + \" pri is \" + prevent_infinite_recursion ); a ++ ; prevent_infinite_recursion ++ ; if ( a < 10 && prevent_infinite_recursion < 10 ) test (); } void main () { test (); } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, the last line chatted to the screen is \"a is 1 pri is 9\" . The last xsChatData in main isn't run at all. 8. Limit On Number Of Params In A Function Call \u00b6 Description: The number of parameters that can be used IN a function call are limited to 12. Attempting to call a function with more parameters results in an error from the game. Note that the error in the example shown below happens at the line the call is made, and not at the function definition itself. This suggests that defining a function with more than 12 parameters can be defined but they can't be called Expected Behaviour: There should ideally be no limit on the amount of parameters for a function Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 void test ( int a1 = 1 , int a2 = 1 , int a3 = 1 , int a4 = 1 , int a5 = 1 , int a6 = 1 , int a7 = 1 , int a8 = 1 , int a9 = 1 , int a10 = 1 , int a11 = 1 , int a12 = 1 , int a13 = 1 ) { } void main () { test ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ); } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using this above script, an error at line 15 (the last line of the function call) is shown If the lines with the function call are commented out, the error goes away 9. XS Files Do Not Transfer In A Lobby \u00b6 Description: When playing in a multiplayer lobby, the required XS scripts are not transfered to other players from the host. (Currently, #includeXS works for scripts that the host has in their profile folder, but recursive includes and scripts from other sources are still not transferred) Expected Behaviour: The main XS script and all XS scripts imported in the main script using include \"fileName.xs\" ; (and potentially more imported scripts inside those scripts too) should be transfered to everyone. Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script that chats something to the screen Include the script in the scenario or RMS Host a lobby with at least two human players Set the map as the above scenario or RMS When the game is started, the host sees the message chatted but the others get a failed to open file error 10. XS Files In Mods Are Not Detected \u00b6 Description: XS scripts in a mod are not detected by the game. Expected Behaviour: Any XS scripts included in a mod should be detected by ANY scenario or RMS trying to use them, even if they are not a part of the mod itself. Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a local mod with an XS script in the following folder: PathToModFolder\\resources\\_common\\xs\\fileName.xs Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, the failed to open file error is shown 11. Crash On Using % Symbols In xsChatData() \u00b6 Description: Cannot escape % symbols in the message, since they are considered special characters because of the %d and %f usage. Expected Behaviour: It should be possible to escape the % character by using a backslash \\ . Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 void main () { // prints `this will not appear in game` xsChatData ( \"this % will not appear in game\" ); // prints `neither will this \\ appear in game` xsChatData ( \"neither will this \\% appear in game\" ); } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, the game will crash 12. Cannot Print 0 Or 1 At The Start Of The Line In xsChatData() \u00b6 Description: If a 0 or 1 character occurs at the beginning of a string that is being chatted to the screen using xsChatData , then the 0 or 1 characters do not appear in the message. Expected Behaviour: 0 or 1 should be shown correctly at the beginning of the line if used in an xsChatData function Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 void main () { // expected `1 the one at the start isn't visible` but // prints ` the one at the start isn't visible` xsChatData ( \"1 the one at the start isn't visible\" ); // expected `0 the zero at the start isn't visible` but // prints ` the zero at the start isn't visible` xsChatData ( \"0 the zero at the start isn't visible\" ); } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, any 1 or 0 at the beginning of the lines are omitted in the resulting message on screen. 13. Using goto With A Non Existent Label Crashes The Game \u00b6 Description: If a goto statement is used as shown below, it crashes the game. How to define a working label in XS is currently unknown Expected Behaviour: The game should warn about wrong usage of goto to a non existent label. How is a label defined in the first place in XS? Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 void main () { goto non_existent_label ; } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, A crash will occur 14. Off By One Error With infiniteLoopLimit \u00b6 Description: If infiniteLoopLimit = n; is used inside a function, it makes it so that ALL loops in that function run a maximum of n+1 times. Expected Behaviour: It should make the loops run only n times, one is extra Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 void main () { infiniteLoopLimit = 10 ; int loopCount = 1 ; while ( true ) { xsChatData ( \"loop count %d\" , loopCount ); loopCount ++ ; } // the last line printed is \"loop count 11\" off by one error here } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, the last line chatted to the screen is \"loop count 11\" . 15. Silent XS Crash with infiniteRecursionLimit \u00b6 Description: If infiniteRecursionLimit = n; is used inside a function, the function may only be called n-1 times in one call stack. Attempting to call it for the n -th time will result in a silent XS crash Expected Behaviour: The n -th function call should run normally, and further calls to the function in the same call stack should be prevented. The entirety of XS execution should not crash Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 int calls = 1 ; void recursionTest () { infiniteRecursionLimit = 10 ; xsChatData ( \"recursion test %d\" , calls ); // the last line chatted to screen is \"recursion test 9\" and no further XS execution takes place calls ++ ; recursionTest (); } void main () { recursionTest (); xsChatData ( \"further xs execution\" ); // this line isn't chatted to the screen } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, the last line chatted to the screen is \"recursion test 9\" . The last xsChatData in main() isn't run at all. 16. Cannot Use Variables Or Expressions In Vector Initialisation \u00b6 Description: When initialising a vector, expressions or variables cannot be used in the initialisation. The code in question is shown below. Expected Behaviour: Expressions and variables should be able to be used when initialising Vectors. Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 void main () { float x = 2 ; float y = 4 ; float z = 6 ; // none of these declarations work: vector v1 = vector ( 5 + 5 , 10 , 4 ); vector v2 = vector ( 5 , 10-1 , 4 ); vector v3 = vector ( 5 , 10 , 4 + 5 ); vector v4 = vector ( x , 5 , 3 ); vector v5 = vector ( 3 , y , 2 ); vector v6 = vector ( 4 , 4 , z ); } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, the Could not parse the code for 'main' function error is shown 17. Unary Negative Does Not Work \u00b6 Description: The unary negative operator does not work. Expected Behaviour: Unary negative operator should return the negative of the number. Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 void main () { int a = 5 ; float b = 3.4 ; // these do not work: int c = - a ; float d = - a ; int e = - b ; float f = - b ; int g = - a + b ; float h = - a + b ; } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, the Could not parse the code for 'main' function error is shown 18. Explicit Type Casting Does Not Work \u00b6 Description: Explicit type casting does not work on variables or at initialisation. Expected Behaviour: Explicit type casting should be able to be used to convert one data type to another. Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 void main () { float a = 5.5 ; float b = ( int ) a ; // will outwright assign 0 to b // expected `b = 5.000000` but // prints `b = 0.000000` xsChatData ( \"b = \" + b ); b = 6.7 ; xsChatData ( \"b (two) = \" + b ); b = ( int ) 5.7 ; // this expression will do nothing // expected `b = 5.000000` but // prints `b = 6.700000` xsChatData ( \"b (three) = \" + b ); } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, the effects described in the code using comments for each case are observed 19. Return Statements Do Not Work As Officially Documented \u00b6 Description: Paranthesis are needed around return expressions for them to work. Expected Behaviour: Return expressions should work with or without paranthesis. Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 int test () { return 5 + 5 ; // instead, `return (5+5);` would work. } void main () { int a = test (); } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, the Could not parse the code for 'test' function error is shown 20. Cannot Declare Variables As A const In Function Parameters \u00b6 Description: It is not possible to declare a function parameter as a const even though it is used in the xsChatData function in the official documentation. Expected Behaviour: It should bee possible to declare function parameters as a const Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 float test ( const float a = -1 ) { return ( a * 5 ); } void main () { xsChatData ( \"test = \" + test ( 5 )); } Include the script in the scenario or RMS When a game is played using the scenario or RMS, the 'const' is not a valid parameter type error is shown Quirks \u00b6 1. Weird Behaviour With Return Statements \u00b6 Description: This behaviour is not understood well Expected Behaviour: An Error? Reproduction Steps: Create a new scenario or RMS Create a new XS script with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 float test ( float a = -1 ) { // thisDoesNot... is not a function return thisDoesNotMatterWhatIsGoingOn ( a ) / 55 + 2 * 2 ; // seems like this is completely ignoring the first term in the expression. } void main () { // prints `test = 4` // once again, note that a float returning function is returning an int xsChatData ( \"test = \" + test ( 5 )); //returns 4 } Include the script in the scenario or RMS Run the main function of the script in the scenario (it will run automatically in an RMS)","title":"Known Bugs"},{"location":"general/xs/bugs/#known-bugs-and-quirks-in-xs-scripting","text":"Written by: Alian713 This page is a list of known bugs, quirks and weird behaviour in XS Scripting.

If you are not a programmer fear not! Refer to the For Beginners section of this guide instead. 1. What is XS? \u00b6 XS stands for External Subroutines and it is a custom programming language that was made by Ensamble Studios. An XS Script can be used in an RMS and Custom Scenarios, and it is a program that can perform calculations and execute different functions and effects. 2. Using an XS \u00b6 To use an XS: Navigate to the folder: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\AoE2DE\\resources\\_common\\xs There should be 2 files in this folder already, called Constants.xs and xs.txt . In here, create a new file with any name ending with .xs . For example, the file can be called filename.xs default0.xs There may be an additional file called default0.xs . Never write code in this file as this is a temporary file and can be overwritten by the game. The file Constants.xs contains a list of constants that can be used in any XS Script directly, by their name. A VSC Extension for syntax highlighting and code auto completion for AoE XS Scripting can be found here To begin with using XS, write this basic code in the file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 // this is a comment /* this is a multiline comment */ void main () { int a = 10 ; int b = 20 ; // the variables cannot be declared by separating them with commas // unlike java or python. // chats to the screen xsChatData ( \"a+b = \" + ( a + b )); } 2.1. In a Custom Scenario \u00b6 Open the scenario in the editor Under the Map tab, type the name of the XS Script that you created in the Script Filename field without the .xs at the end. For example, if your file is called filename.xs then you will write filename in this field. Now, under the Triggers tab in the editor, add a new trigger, then add a new effect. (If you do not know what a trigger/effect is, please go through the Custom Scenarios: Triggers: Trigger Basics section of this guide) From the Effects List select Script Call . You can now use the functions in the XS Script in the message box using a normal function call. Keep in mind, only those functions that do not take any parameters work here! The main() function that we made above is automatically run when the scenario is played. If there are no errors in the code, clicking the E#0: Script Call effect will turn it green. If there is an error in the script, an error message will be shown. Testing the scenario now will run the Script Call effect in the trigger defined above, which in turn will run the main() function in the XS Script and 30 will be shown in the chat. 2.2. In an RMS \u00b6 Open the RM Script in a text editor At the very top, type #includeXS filename.xs . Here, filename.xs is the name of the file that you created above. The main(); function is automatically called when a map is generated using the RMS. To test, load the RMS in a single player (or multi player) lobby and start the game. It is recommended that you use a custom scenario to test XS Scripts, as it is easier to debug them in the editor. Now that you have set up an XS file with a main() function inside, you can type code inside this function to do different things! We'll be walking through all of the different things that are known to be possible one by one: 3. Variables Data Types \u00b6 There are a total of 5 data types supported by XS, they are: Data Type Syntax int int a = 10 ; float float a = 3.1 ; string string a = \"string\" ; bool bool a = true ; vector vector v = vector ( 1.2 , 2.3 , 3 ); Refer to the Vector Manipulation section of this guide for all the different functions that can be used on vectors. No Vars in Vector Initialisation Variables cannot be used in vector initialisation. For example: vector v = vector ( x , y , z ); does not work. Here x , y , z are floating point values. Use vector v = xsVectorSet ( x , y , z ); instead. Constants and Scope Constant Variables Syntax const int a = 10 ; or const float PI = 3.1415 ; will declare an immutable variable. Scope of a Variable The concept of local and global variables applies to XS. 4. Operations \u00b6 4.1. Arithmetic Operations \u00b6 Operation Syntax Addition a+b Subtraction a-b Multiplication a*b Division a/b Modulo a%b Refer to the Mathematical Operations section of this guide for useful mathematical functions. Unary Negative There is no unary negative operator in XS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 void main () { int a = 10 ; // this does not work: int b = - a + 20 ; // instead use: int b = 0 - a + 20 ; } 4.2. Prefix and Postfix Operations \u00b6 Operation Syntax Posfix increment a++ Postfix decrement a-- Prefix operations are not supported by XS. 4.3 Shorthand Assignment Operations \u00b6 Shorthand Assignment operations are not supported by XS. 4.4 Bitwise Operations \u00b6 Bitwise operations are not supported by XS. 4.5. Relational Operations \u00b6 Operation Syntax Less Than a < b Greater Than a > b Less Than or Equal To a <= b Greater Than or Equal To a >= b Equal To a == b Not Equal To a != b Relational Operators on Strings These relational operators also work on strings, for example a < b tells you if a lexicographically preceeds b . 4.6. Boolean Operations \u00b6 Operation Syntax AND a && b OR a || b Negation is not supported by XS. DataType of Result of Operation Due to a bug at the moment, the data type of the answer of any operation is determined by the first operand. This means that 9 * 5.5 evaluates to 49 instead of 49.5 . However, 5.5 * 9 will correctly evaluate to 49.5 . 5. Flow Control Statements \u00b6 The following flow control statements are supported by XS: if else if construct: Example Syntax: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 void main () { int a = 10 ; float b = 20 ; int c = 30 ; float max = 0 ; if ( a > b && a > c ) max = a ; else if ( b > c && b > a ) max = b ; else max = c ; } switch - case construct: Example Syntax: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 void main () { int a = 10 ; switch ( a ) { case 1 : { // do stuff } case 2 : { // do stuff } case 3 : { // do stuff } default : { // do stuff } } } while loop: Example Syntax: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 void main () { int a = 0 ; while ( a < 10 ) { xsChatData ( \"a = \" + a ); a ++ ; } } for loop: Syntax: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 void main () { // this loops a from 0 to 10 for ( a = 0 ; < 10 ) xsChatData ( \"a = \" + a ); // this loops a from 10 to 0 for ( a = 10 ; > 0 ) xsChatData ( \"a = \" + a ); // unlike java, you do not need to specify an increment or decrement // the for loop takes care of that // step sizes unfortunately cannot be changed. } 6. Functions \u00b6 Syntax: 1 2 3 4 returnType functionName ( dataType parameter1 = defaultValue1 , dataType parameter2 = defaultValue2 ) { return ( value ); // value must be enclosed by parantheses } Example Syntax: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 int max ( int a = 0 , int b = 2 ) { if ( a > b ) return ( a ); return ( b ); // the return value must always be inside parantheses. } void main () { xsChatData ( \"max \" + max ( 10 , 20 )); } An XS Script can import other XS Scripts using the following syntax: 1 include \"absolute/or/relative/path/to/file.xs\" ; 7. Arrays \u00b6 Refer to the Array Manipulation section of this guide on how to use arrays. Standard syntax like int a [] = new int [ 10 ]; or a [ 2 ]; is not supported by XS. 8. Type Casting \u00b6 int , float and bool data types can be implicitly casted into each other. All of them can be implicitly casted into strings by doing string a = \"this would work \" + 5.6 ; . However, string a = 5.5 ; will not work, instead use: string a = \"\" + 5.5 ; . It is unknown if XS supports proper explicit type casting 9. Rules \u00b6 A rule is a block of code that can be set to repeatedly execute at set intervals throughout the duration of the game. A rule is always initialised outside of a method. Its usage looks like: Syntax: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 rule ruleName // This is the name of the rule. Follows same naming laws as variables. active / inactive // this is the initial state of the rule, active means that runs by default // and inactive means that it wont run by default. // this is similar to how triggers work when you enable/disable them. group groupName // the group that this rule belongs to. Follows same naming laws as variables. minInterval < int > // the minimum time interval that must pass before the block is executed again maxInterval < int > // the maximum time interval that may pass before the block has to be executed again highFrequency // Loop the rule 60 times every physical second (this is independant of inagme speed) // Only one of \"highFrequency\" or \"minInterval\" and \"maxInterval\" are used. Both cannot be used together runImmediately // It is currently unknown as to what this option does priority < int > // rules are executed in order of their descending priority { // code to execute } Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 int a = 0 ; // This rule prints the value of a every 2 seconds. rule chatTheValueOfA active minInterval 2 maxInterval 2 group chatGroup { xsChatData ( \"a = \" + a ); a ++ ; } There are a lot of built in XS functions that can interact with rules. Check the Rules Section of this guide. The variable cActivationTime , when used inside the block of a rule, gives the time of activation of the rule in seconds. With that, you now know everything that is currently known to work with XS Scripts.

Literally, they are different \"scenarios\" the game can be played in. The Scenario Editor \u00b6 The Scenario Editor is the tool that every map maker uses to make and test scenarios. To open a new scenario in the editor, Click Single Player in the main menu Click Editors Click Create Scenario To open a saved scenario in the editor, Double-click the scenario from the list in the editors menu in step 3 above To open an externally downloaded scenario in the editor, Click Open Scenario Folder in the editors menu in step 3 above Put the downloaded scenario in this folder To see the newly added scenario in the editors menu, go back to the main menu and open the editors menu again. When you load into a new scenario, it is a blank canvas for you to play with! In the editor, there are quite a few tabs that you can see at the top, their functionalities are discussed below: 1. Map \u00b6 Under the Map tab in the editor, there are several options to change the map, they are discussed below: 1.1. Map Style \u00b6 Blank Map : This option generates a map of the same terrain throughout the map. The default map that is generated when a new scenario is loaded is a blank map with grass terrain. Random Map : This option generates a map from an RMS. (RMS stands for Random Map Script, they are scripts that generate regular maps like Arabia) Seed Map : This option generates a map from an RMS using a specified seed. Question What is a seed you ask? Each generation of a particular RMS in the game has a number attached to it called its \"seed\" that uniquely identifies that particular generation of the RMS. Generating a map with the same RMS and seed twice will give you the exact same map! 1.2. AI Map Type \u00b6 This option is used by AIs to figure out what kind of a map they are playing on. This is important if you have AIs in your map because you want them to go for water builds when you have water on your map. Lets say that the map is nomad themed, then setting the AI Map Type to Nomad would allow AI players to properly play in a nomad style. 1.3. Colour Mood \u00b6 This setting changes the colour theme (lighting) of the map. By default it is set to Empty which means no colour theme. Colour themes are used for aesthetic reasons only and do not effect gameplay. For exmaple, if you are making a map set in the winter season, then using the winter colour theme could be an option. 1.4. Team Positions \u00b6 This setting is for when you generate maps from an RMS. It determines if players in the same team are placed in order of their colour or if they are randomly distributed throughout the map For example, The teams are currently set to Players 1,3,5,7 vs Players 2,4,6,8 and generating the map with team positions on gives this result: Notice that players 1,3,5,7 who are on the same team have, generated in that particular order (going counter clockwise in the image) and that players 2,4,6,8 have also generated in that order. Generating the map with team positions off on the other hand, gives this result: Notice that now, players 1,3,5,7 who are on the same team, have generated in random positions. Similarly players 2,4,6,8 have generated in no particular order. Also note that even though the positions within the team are random, the players are still grouped on each side of the map by team. To be more precise, this option generates players in each team in order of their player numbers. Players do not have to be in the specific teams used in the above exmaple for this to work. 1.5. Extend Map \u00b6 This features is useful for expanding an already existing map if you need to use more space. To use it, Click the checkbox called Extend Map . This brings up two new options, New Map Size and a Map Offset . New Map Size : the size of the new map that will be generated. Map Offset : determines where to place the existing map on the new map. For example, Extending this 4 player map with a New Map Size of 8 players and a Map Offset of North gives the following result: Remember, the top corner of the map is North! 1.6. Script Filename \u00b6 This is the place where you need to enter the name of any XS scripts that you are using in your map. XS scripts are covered in the XS Scripts section of this guide 2. Global Victory \u00b6 Under the Global Victory tab in the editor, there are options that allow you to define custom victory conditions for all players. They are all discussed below: 2.1. Standard \u00b6 A player wins by either defeating all enemies, or capturing 5 relics and holding them for 200 years, or constructing and holding a wonder for 200 years 2.2. Conquest \u00b6 A player can only win by defeating all enemy players 2.3. Score \u00b6 The first player to reach the specified score wins 2.4. Time Limit \u00b6 The game is played until the specified time limit. When the time limit is reached, the player with the highest score wins 2.5. Custom \u00b6 This victory condition can be customised using the following options: Conquest this is the same as the victory condition in point 2. above Exploration the first player to reach the specified percentage of the map explored wins the game. (There is a text box infront of this option to specify percentage) Relics the first player to capture the specified quantity of relics wins the game. Unlike Standard Victory, a playar wins as soon as they have gathered the relics and do not need to hold them for 200 years. (There is a text box infront of this option to specify quantity) Any One a player can complete any one of the victory condition enabled above to win All a player has to complete all of the victory conditions enabled above to win 3. Terrain \u00b6 Under the Terrain tab in the editor, there are a lot of options to modify the terrain of the map. Each of them are discussed below: 3.1. Map \u00b6 This option allows you to manually place down terrain on the map. Brush Size : allows you to pick how large of an area you want to affect on the map at once Layering Mode : allows you to blend and layer another type of terrain on top of the base terrain. Note that the terrain properties like buildings that can be placed on terrain are still determined by the base terrain. This means that you won't be able to build buildings on ice layered with grass but you will be able to build buildings on grass layered with ice Eye Candy : determines if the terrain you place automatically spawns eye candy on top of it. Eye candy are plants and other units that are generated for aesthetic reasons only, hence the name \"eye candy\" No Waves on Shore : disables waves on water throughout the map Water Definitions : this option changes what water looks like throughout the map Different water definitions are shown below: Preset_Main : Preset_FE1 : Preset_FE2 : Preset_WickedWitch : Beach Type : this option changes the type of beach terrain that is placed down when water terrain is placed. Exploring the different beach types has been left as an excersise for the reader. 3.2. Elevation \u00b6 This option allows you to change the elevation of existing tiles on the map. Brush Size : allows you to pick how large of an area you want to affect on the map at once Tip In the editor, there are 7 different levels of elevation to chose from, but the elevation can actually have higher or lower values. In the editor, there is no way to make water have elevation either, but it is actually possible to give water elevation as well. Both of these things requires use of external map editing tools and are covered under the AoE2ScenarioParser section of this guide. 3.3. Cliffs \u00b6 This option allows you to place cliffs on your map. There are two types of cliffs to chose from, Granite and Sandstone. They function exactly the same, and differ only in their appearence. Tip A cliff is actually a gaia object that can be rotated, if you go to the Units tab, and enable the Rotate option, you will be able to click the cliff and rotate it (right click rotates it in the opposite direction). There are a few rotations of the cliff objects that actually do not have graphics for them and hence appear invisible. but since they are still present on the map, just not visible, they block units from going through them. This mechanic can be used to make invisible walls on the map! 3.4. Map Copy \u00b6 This option allows you to copy a part of the map and paste it using a brush. There are options to rotate and flip the selected area as well. Bug When a selection that is rectangular is rotated, the highlighted area that shows the brush DOES NOT rotate accordingly to show this rotation, but the game still pastes a rotated as you would expect. There is also another option called Change Player . This option allows you to change the player of the units in the selection to another player when pasting the selection. 3.5. Erase \u00b6 This option allows you to selectively remove parts of the map in an area using a brush. The objects that can be selectively removed when using this feature are: Buildings Gaia Objects Invisible Units Layered Terrain Trees Units Abstract The layering mode option in this tab seems to have no effect on the way that elements are erased. 4. Options \u00b6 Under the Options tab in the editor, there are options to: 4.1. Point of View \u00b6 Set the specified player's starting PoV to your current view in the editor using the set view button. Once the view is set, check that it works by clicking go to view 4.2. Testing Difficulty \u00b6 Set the Testing Difficulty 4.3. Full Tech Tree \u00b6 Enable Full Tech Tree for all players. Warning This option does not disable civ bonuses unlike the full tech tree option in normal games! 4.4. Disable Objects \u00b6 Disable Buildings, Units or Techs by moving them from the Full List to the Disabled List by clicking the < arrow. remove an object from the disabled list by clicking > . The << and >> move all items at once Note: Using this option to disable objects is not recommended as there is a better way to do it via triggers which are covered in the Triggers section of this guide. 4.5. Collide & Correcting \u00b6 Enabling this option makes stationary units move out the way to let moving units pass through. 4.6. Villager Force Drop \u00b6 Makes villagers instantly lose their resources when their tasks are switched instead of losing when they actually start working on the other task. This mimics FE behaviour, i.e. if villagers are switched from hunters to sheep, they don't lose any food. 4.7. Block Humanity Team Change \u00b6 Lock Teams ONLY for human players. 5. Players \u00b6 Under the Players tab in the editor, there are several properties that can be changed about the players 5.1. Number of Players \u00b6 The total number of players you have in your scenario 5.2. Starting Age \u00b6 Specify the starting age for the currently selected player 5.3. Colour \u00b6 Specify the colour of the currently selected player 5.4. Starting Resources \u00b6 Food , Wood , Stone , Gold determine the starting amount of the currently selected player's resources 5.5. Pop Limit \u00b6 Determine the maximum population limit allowed for the currently selected player. This value is capped at 500 5.6. Base Priority \u00b6 This option seems to have no effect on the game. Question If you are aware of what this does, please reach out to one of the authors of this guide and let them know! 5.7. Tribe Name \u00b6 Sets the name for the currently selected player if they are an AI. Does not effect human players 5.8. Name String ID \u00b6 This field is used for refering to names that the game recognises by default. It can be used to automatically set a Tribe name by using a value that the game recognises. Trying out the value 1 in this field on an AI and seeing what happens is left as an excersise for the reader. 5.9. Personality \u00b6 The AI to use for this player if they are not a human player. Pick E3-p2.ai to simulate an afk player 5.10. Player Type \u00b6 This setting doesn't make a difference to gameplay. The only difference between the two options is that setting this to Either wont auto fill lobby slots with AIs. Setting it to AI will automatically set that player up for you in a lobby game 5.11. Civilization \u00b6 Set the currently selected player's civilization 5.12. Lock Civ \u00b6 Prevent the currently selected player from changing their civilization in a lobby 5.13. Architecture \u00b6 Change the currently selected player's architecture set to another civilization's. 5.14. Swap Players \u00b6 Swap the settings for the currently selected player with the specified player. 6. Messages \u00b6 Under the Messages tab, there are different options for displaying text in the scenario. 6.1. Scenario Instructions \u00b6 This option lets you set the text that is shown in the Instructions tab of the Objectives Panel . Note The Objective Panel can be opened by clicking the button to the right of the Tech Tree button at the top of the screen. 6.2. Objectives \u00b6 This option lets you set the text that is shown in the Objectives tab of the Objectives Panel . 6.3. Hints \u00b6 This option lets you set the text that is shown in the Hints tab of the Objectives Panel . 6.4. Scout \u00b6 This option lets you set the text that is shown in the Scout tab of the Objectives Panel . 6.5. Victory \u00b6 This option lets you set the text that is shown to players who win the game before the statistics screen. 6.6. Defeat \u00b6 This option lets you set the text that is shown to players who lose the game before the statistics screen. 7. Units \u00b6 Under the Units tab, there are several options to place and manipulate units. 7.1. Placing Units \u00b6 Units can be placed on the map from the 4 menus in this tab: The game categorises all unit objects in the game into 4 categories, Units , Buildings , Heroes , Others . Units allows you to place down units that are most commonly seen in regular games. Buildings allows you to place down most of the different buildings in the game. Heroes allows you to place down the hero units used in campaigns and scenarios. Others these are miscellanious units that do not directly come under any of the above categories. By default, units are placed in a random rotation, however scrolling up/down before placing a unit allows you to fix its rotation to whichever rotation you want. To go back to placing in a random rotation, select another unit in the menu and then re select the unit for placement. While placing these units, changing the player to Gaia will reveal additional hidden units like trees, mines, wolves and other units that only Gaia can own in normal games. There are additional units in the game that cannot be seen in the editor's lists even when using Gaia to place them. There are two ways to use these hidden units: Use a create object trigger with the hidden unit's object ID Use the Advanced Genie Editor (A.G.E.) to unhide hidden units in the editor to allow for manual placement. If you do not know how to do either of those, you can refer to the Effects section of this guide for the first option, and/or refer to the Unhide Editor Units section of this guide 7.2. Deleting Units \u00b6 Units that are already placed on the map can be deleted from the map by the following ways: The first and the most obvious option is to use the Delete option in this tab. This allows us to delete units one by one from the map. The first option can be tedious if you need to delete a large amount of units, thus the second option is to use the Erase Units option in the Erase menu under the Terrain tab. Refer to 3.5. Erase about how to use the Erase option. 7.3. Moving Units \u00b6 Units already placed on the map can be moved around on the map by using the Move option in this tab. 7.4. Rotating Units \u00b6 Units already placed on the map can be rotated by using the Rotate option in this tab. After the Rotate option is selected, clicking a unit will rotate it clockwise, and right clicking it will rotate it counter clockwise. 7.5. Selecting Units \u00b6 When selecting a unit, its statistics like HP, Attack, Armour and units garrisoned inside it are shown. Units inside other units can be deleted using the garrison delete. 7.6. Converting Units \u00b6 This option allows you to convert existing units from one or more players to another player. When enabled, 9 new options (to the right) appear in the menu for selecting which players' units you want to convert from . The currently selected player (on the left) is the player the units will be converted to . After picking a Brush Size when you click on an area, all of the units belonging to the players being converted from will be converted to the selected player. Remember the players being converted from are selected on the right side using the checkboxes, and the player being converted to is the one selected in the dropdown to the left! 8. Cinematics \u00b6 Under the Cinematics tab, there are options to change the movie clips displayed before or after a scenario. Bug These are mainly used in the campaigns, and functionality for changing them in scenarios is bugged as of the time of the writing of this guide. 9. Diplomacy \u00b6 Under the Diplomacy tab, there are options to change the diplomacy settings of the game: 9.1. Diplomacy Stance \u00b6 The grid of checkboxes to the right allows you to change each player's stance with all of the other players. 9.2. Lock Teams \u00b6 This option makes it so that teams cannot be changed by players in the game. They can still be changed by triggers. 9.3. Players Choose Teams \u00b6 Disabling this option will not allow players to pick teams in the lobby before the start of the game. The teams will not be locked however, and may still be changed in game unless the Lock Teams option is also enabled. 9.4. Random Start Points \u00b6 This option seems to have no effect on the game. Question If you are aware of what this does, please reach out to one of the authors of this guide and let them know! 10. Triggers \u00b6 Under the Triggers tab, triggers can be manipulated in a scenario. Triggers are the most powerful component of a scenario as they allow us to do a plethora of different things in a game. They can be used to add more dynamics and game mechanics to a scenario, almost anything that you could think of (within the context of AoE2 and its own limits) is possible to do in some way using triggers. Details about how to use triggers are covered in the Triggers section of this guide. 11. Useful Hotkeys \u00b6 Some hotkeys that are useful to know and make the workflow of making and testing a scenario faster Scrolling up and down on a dropdown list makes the values go up and down the lists as well Pressing or holding a letter in any object selection menu will cycle through the list of objects If you are on a tab where a player can be selected (except triggers) then pressing numbers 1-8 will switch to that player When testing a scenario, pressing Ctrl + Shift and F# where # is the number of a player, will let you control that player. For example, pressing Ctrl + Shift + F4 will shift your control to player 4 Scrolling when placing objects will rotate them. Some gaia buildings and units have entirely different graphics for different rotations! Pressing Ctrl + G once allows for off grid placement of units. Pressing it again allows for stacking units and off grid placement together. Pressing a 3 rd time allows for on grid unit placement with stacking enabled. Pressing a 4 th time makes it go back to default! Even Buildings can be stacked using this option! Ctrl + Q Quit the scenario editor Ctrl + A Toggle hitboxes on every unit on the map Ctrl + S Save the scenario Ctrl + L Load a scenario Ctrl + N Create a new scenario Tabs F1 - F10 selects a tab in the scenario editor. F1 - Map, F2 - Terrain, and so on Ctrl + W Switch to the Messages tab Ctrl + R Switch to the Triggers tab Ctrl + T Switch to the Terrain tab Ctrl + U Switch to the Units tab Ctrl + O Switch to the Options tab Ctrl + P Switch to the Players tab Ctrl + D Switch to the Diplomacy tab Ctrl + C Switch to the Cinematics tab Ctrl + V Switch to the Global Victory tab Ctrl + M Switch to the Map tab Ctrl + Space Test Scenario (Currently bugged, causes a crash in the game D:)","title":"Scenario Basics"},{"location":"scenarios/basics/#the-scenario-editor","text":"The Scenario Editor is the tool that every map maker uses to make and test scenarios.

Generating the map with team positions off on the other hand, gives this result: Notice that now, players 1,3,5,7 who are on the same team, have generated in random positions. Similarly players 2,4,6,8 have generated in no particular order. Also note that even though the positions within the team are random, the players are still grouped on each side of the map by team.

Some gaia buildings and units have entirely different graphics for different rotations! Pressing Ctrl + G once allows for off grid placement of units. Pressing it again allows for stacking units and off grid placement together. Pressing a 3 rd time allows for on grid unit placement with stacking enabled. Pressing a 4 th time makes it go back to default! Even Buildings can be stacked using this option!

Using triggers allows us to essentially introduce data mods (and much more) into the game, WHILE the game is running! This means that, for example, you could have a scenario where at the 30 minute mark, all players must pay a certain amount of resources or face some consequences. Another example is one where certain actions taken by the player can cause different events. If you have ever played CBA (or sighed at people who play CBA) or played any of the campaigns in the game, all of them are made possible using triggers in a scenario. Another good example of just what triggers can do is this game mode Perk Pandemonium . Triggers introduce dynamics into a game and allow us to make interesting game modes as described above. Learning how to use triggers is simple and every map maker should be familiar with them to be able to make the best use of a scenario! 1. Getting Started: The UI \u00b6 To work with triggers in your scenario, you need to go to the Triggers tab in the editor. Here, you will see two boxes to the left. The box at the top lists all the existing triggers in a scenario. When a trigger is selected, the box at the bottom displays the list of conditions and effects for that trigger. What do the buttons under the boxes do? Under the 1 st box: New : creates a new trigger. Copy : After selecting a trigger, clicking this will create a new trigger that has the exact same settings, conditions and effects as the selected trigger. Delete : delete the selected trigger. This cannot be undone! Info : show settings of the selected trigger Under the 2 nd box: New Effect : creates a new effect under the selected trigger. New Condition : creates a new condition under the selected trigger. Delete : delete the selected condition or effect. This cannot be undone! Copy : copy the selected condition or effect. But wait, what are effects and conditions? Effects and Conditions are the basic elements of triggers that allow us to take certain actions, make decisions and do a lot more cool stuff. They are covered in more detail in the Effects and Conditions sections of the guide For now, simply put, an effect is the action that the trigger has to take and a condition is literally the thing which must be fulfilled before the action is allowed to be taken. 2. Trigger Settings \u00b6 When a trigger is selected, the settings related to it are displayed. The following is a description of all the settings and what they do: Enabled : this property controls if the trigger is active from the beginning of the game. An active trigger is one which can execute its effects immediately if its conditions are fulfilled. If a trigger is not active, then its effects will not be executed even if its conditions are fulfilled. Looping : this property controls if the trigger deactivates itself after running once or if it repeatedly executes its effects when its conditions are fulfilled. Triggers loop once every second Description : this textbox is used for displaying objectives in the Objectives panel of the scenario. See the setting below: Display as objective : When this checkbox is selected, the text in the Description field is shown in the Objectives panel of the scenario. The Objectives panel is the one that is opened when you click the button next to the tech tree at the top of the screen ingame. This panel is visible to ALL players in the game. Description String Table ID : This field is the same as the 5.8. Name String ID Short Description : This textbox is used for displaying objectives on screen ingame. See the setting below: Display on Screen : When this checkbox is selected, the text in the Short Description field is shown to the right side of the screen of ALL players in the game. If it does not show up for you when you enable this, try pressing the F4 key (or the score button) a few times. Make Header : When this checkbox is selected and Display on Screen is also selected, that particular Short Description is displayed with a bigger font size. Mute Objectives : When this checkbox is selected, completing an objective will not trigger a sound. Display Order : The objectives are displayed in descending order of priority. Short Description String Table ID : This field is the same as the 5. Description String Table ID . 3. General Information About Triggers \u00b6 When the conditions inside a trigger which is displayed as an objective are fulfilled, then the objective is marked as completed. A completed objective is strikethrough-ed in the Objectives panel and checked when displayed on screen. Disabling the trigger related to that objective will remove the objective from screen or the Objectives panel completely. A trigger with no conditions will immediately execute its effects on activation. There is a theoretical limit of 4294967295 triggers in a scenario. Roll The Dice in older versions of the game is known to use about 16000 triggers. There is a theoretical limit of 2147483647 effects and 2147483647 conditions inside one trigger. Perk Pandemonium is known to use up to 250 effects inside one trigger. Triggers are executed in the order that they were created in, and not the order of their appearence from top to bottom. The effects inside one trigger are also executed in the order that they were created in, and not the order of their appearence from top to bottom. The conditions inside a trigger are checked according to the order that they were created in as well. For the effects of a trigger to execute, all the conditions of the trigger must be fulfilled except in one case (when an OR condition is used). A trigger will give up on checking the rest of its conditions as soon as a condition that is false is encountered except in one case (when an OR condition is used). These rules are discussed in greater detail in the Conditions section of the guide.","title":"Trigger Basics"},{"location":"scenarios/triggers/basics/#what-are-triggers","text":"Usually a regular AoE2 game proceeds without anything about the gameplay changing in the middle of the game.

What are effects? \u00b6 Effects are one of the two basic elements of triggers (the other one being Conditions). They are essentially \"cheats\" in some sense, that allow you to change information about the game as the game is being played. All technologies in the game utilise effects to do what they are meant to do. Usually, a technology almost always uses multiple effects in combination to achieve its purposes.

Some common examples are: placing units in a grid, copying triggers for all players or creating many similar effects. These sorts of problems can easily be done using a programming language! It's also a perfect tool to be able to tweak your minigames or maps. Let's say you have a minigame where you get 10 gold for each unit you kill. And later you find out, it's quite over powered, so you want to change all effects to 5 gold per unit. If you used the parser to setup all triggers and effects and you had a variable like: gold_per_unit = 10 you can just change it to 5, rerun the code and you fixed it in one go! The parser works by reading a scenario file, and converting it to objects in the programming language Python3 . You can then use the functions available to easily add or change things in the scenario. A couple example functions: add_unit , add_trigger , copy_trigger_per_player and many, many more! Check out the official AoE2ScenarioParser documentation for the most up-to-date installation guide and how to get started!
